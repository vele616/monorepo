In this episode of After Work Talks, we are reviewing a CV from an actual entry-level software developer, while providing helpful tips on how to improve resume writing skills. If you are introducing a complete change in your profession or you are fresh out of university and looking for your first job in the world's fastest-growing industry, this video is for you! 

We'd like to thank our friend Peter for sending us his CV which helped us create this video review. Peter's original CV was decent enough, but with just a few modifications we created a document that every headhunter or HR person will want to take a second look at. 

Would you like us to help you too? You can watch all the helpful tips in the video below and if you need our assistance feel free to send us your CV to afterworktalks@crocoder.dev! 

You can download the new version of Peter's CV here!

The idea of After Work Talks video content emerged after more than 10 years of working in the IT field because of our desire to share experiences in finding the right solutions, both for job seekers and employers alike.  We've written hundreds of CVs and applied to an equal amount of job openings. We went through many interviews and all kinds of tests with headhunters, human resources, CEOs, CTOs, team leaders, fellow developers and everyone in between amid the process of landing the perfect job. After Work Talks is a community that aims to demystify the complications that almost everyone faces during the job-hunting process in the IT field.
