Auth0 is a unicorn that just closed a $120M Series F round of funding, with total capital raised to date of $330M and valuation of nearly $2B. We are growing rapidly and looking for exceptional new team members to add to our exceptional talent pool - and who will help take us to the next level of success. One team, one score. 

Our vision is to provide people with secure access to any application in one click or less. And our promise is to make identity work for everyone—whether you’re a developer looking to innovate, or a security professional looking to mitigate. We are looking for curious, excited, boundary-pushing team members. So, if you’re a big thinker who is nimble and adaptable, Auth0 may be an ideal place for you to shine.

As a Content Engineer at Auth0, your job is to **empower developers to innovate** and secure their apps with Auth0. We're looking for someone who can create content and build apps that help developers get their jobs done as painlessly as possible. In this role, you may find yourself updating existing content, creating new applications, writing tutorials, making videos, helping with documentation, assisting with the launch of a new feature, or reviewing the work of a fellow Content Engineer or our guest authors. You know the importance of staying in touch with real developers and will have opportunities outside the day-to-day to learn what developers experience firsthand, whether that is helping build a workshop or supporting a hackathon.

## What You Bring

*   You're an educator at heart who loves teaching developers how to build amazing things.
*   You have some experience producing technical documentation, either for an internal or external audience. Through writing technical blog posts, documentation, support tickets, or even READMEs you've realized the power — and challenge — of writing technical content.
*   You’ve also felt that unique satisfaction when a developer learns something new thanks to what you wrote.
*   2+ years experience as a Backend Developer Java, Python, or .Net
*   You will be the first to try new APIs and products.
*   You're not afraid to roll your sleeves up to write code snippets and sample applications. Even better, you can articulate ways they can be improved to make all developers’ lives easier. 
*   A meticulous eye for detail: accuracy, conciseness, consistency, and relevance. 
*   You’re a data-informed decision maker who experiments with new ways to help our customers learn our products faster.
*   You ask questions, capture metrics, and use the results to advise where our success stands and opportunities lie.
*   You enjoy collaborating with teammates and multi-functional teams.
*   Your passion for technology inspires you to explore your curiosity; you love learning new things. 
*   You find a fast-paced, constantly iterative environment engaging and stimulating.
*   You can write proficiently in English.
