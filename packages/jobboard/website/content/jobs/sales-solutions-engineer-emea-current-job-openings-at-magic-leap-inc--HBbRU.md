Magic Leap has one of the most exciting technologies in an industry that is breaking new ground and solving new problems.  Our team needs Solutions Engineers to provide a technical skill set that works with the sales team directly with customers.  The SE will be part of a growing team helping to shape our business, lead application development and customization, and prototype solutions directly with customers in various industries: Healthcare, Manufacturing (especially Auto and Transportation), Aerospace, Military, AEC, and Oil & Gas, among others. 

We love scrappy.  We look for people that can approach any challenge with a cool head and possess a no-problem-too-big-or-too-small attitude.  You will thrive in an environment where you are juggling many balls at the same time and find solving new challenges to be stimulating.  No day is like the prior.  Ideally, you will have a background in software development, along with experience in real-time 3D development on multiple platforms, preferably AR or VR.  Your role will involve meeting clients, providing support, and giving technical demonstrations on the Magic Leap product portfolio and other third-party solutions running on Magic Leap. This role can be based in London, Belgium, Switzerland, or remotely in an EU country.
