**About Kentik**

Kentik is the network observability company. Many of the [world’s most recognizable brands](https://www.kentik.com/customers/) rely on our SaaS platform to make sense of their networks, relying on our infinite granularity, automated insights, and insanely fast search to answer key business questions. Our rapidly growing, geographically distributed engineering team builds state-of-the-art products that are supported by a truly big data platform that processes trillions(!!) of records per day. To this end, our engineering culture emphasizes collaborative communication, openness to ideas, and practical solution design. To find out more, read [our blog](https://www.kentik.com/blog/) at [kentik.com](http://kentik.com/) and follow us [@kentikinc](https://twitter.com/kentikinc).

The true meaning of Kentik is visibility. We are committed to making sure everyone feels empowered to use their voice, has a sense of belonging and is represented at Kentik. We don’t look for individuals who fit the culture, but those who will continue to add to the culture. We encourage everyone to apply, especially those individuals who are underrepresented in the industry: people of color, LGBTQI+ community, women, individuals with disabilities (both seen and unseen), veterans, people of any age or family status.

**About the role**

Kentik backend services ingest, enrich and store traffic metadata and metrics from the world's largest networks. They gather configuration and topology snapshots, actively monitor our customer's infrastructure and trigger automated responses in response to outages and attacks. Together, they form an internet-scale, highly available, distributed system that is the foundation to Kentik's ability to deliver complete end-to-end network observability to our customers.

Our insights services look at mountains of data using statistical methods and machine learning to surface useful, actionable insights for our customers.

We are looking for experienced backend engineers wanting to apply their skills and experience taking Kentik to an industrial scale, specifically improving and scaling our insights systems to generate quality insights for an ever growing set of customers, devices, and use-cases.
