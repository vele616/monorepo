## About BMAT

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, Tel-Aviv, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.

## Our Culture

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

## Job Summary

In our Charts team at BMAT, we build applications to provide real-time data mainly to record labels, music publishers and recorded music associations. We offer customisable streaming, radio and TV analytics which allow these companies to better evaluate their performances and make well-informed decisions.

Your responsibilities will be to operate, maintain and extend such applications and services so they keep up with the demands of our customers.

Our systems process millions of music usage events every day, so our solutions are quite data heavy. We use many different technologies and platforms including but not limited to SQL, NoSQL and Column Oriented Databases, Apache Airflow, Docker, ElasticSearch and IAAS providers.

## What we need

We are looking for a resourceful, driven and action-oriented developer who is able to work with complex stacks which involve multiple technologies, and is capable of learning about new ones autonomously.

We need someone who is able to weigh up the compromises made when finding the most suitable solution to a problem in any given time. Someone who thinks ahead and considers the bigger picture.

You’ll be responsible for making design decisions and presenting them to the rest of the team—so you must be capable of carrying out independent research to gain a solid understanding of the key elements involved in your solutions.

## Requirements

*   Solid Python knowledge with 4+ years of experience
*   Strong experience with SQL databases
*   Experience with IAAS providers, preferably with AWS
*   Linux and GIT experience
*   Experience with software design life cycle and best practices (code reviews, testing)
*   Clear communication, resolutive and creative
*   A very strong interest in music and the music industry

## Preferred extras

*   Previous knowledge of the music industry
*   Experience with Column Oriented Databases
*   Experience with open source web application frameworks (Flask, Django)
*   Experience designing and developing RESTful APIs
*   Experience with Docker or an equivalent technology
*   Knowledge of UNIX networking and distributed systems
*   Experience with ElasticSearch and/or Lucene
*   Some Javascript knowledge, ideally with the Vue.js framework

## You Can Enjoy

*   Full-time job.
*   Flexible working location and remote working.
*   Flexibility on working hours.
*   Flat hierarchy.  
    
*   Free English and Spanish classes.
*   Wide range of online and onsite courses.
*   Possibility to choose your hardware and tools.  
    
*   Becoming part of a diverse and multicultural team based in Barcelona obsessed with bettering the music industry

Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.
