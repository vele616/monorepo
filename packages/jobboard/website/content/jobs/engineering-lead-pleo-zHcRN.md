Have you ever had a favorite recipe that never failed you? Maybe passed through generations in your family or you found it on Reddit or you might even come up with it yourself, doesn‚Äôt really matter. What matters is the same recipe, amazing taste every time. And then one day you might be feeling adventurous, or just by accident, you add an extra ingredient, maybe just a touch of a new spice and ... mindblown.gif !!¬† Turns out it can taste even better! Has this ever happened to you?!

‚ÄúBut wait, isn‚Äôt this supposed to be a job ad?!‚Äù I hear you thinking. Bear with us for a bit more and it will all make sense at the end :)¬†

If you‚Äôve been following our job opportunities you might have noticed that this is the first time we are hiring for this position. Our recipe so far has been to hire great software engineers and then develop those who are interested in this career path into team leads and it has been working quite well. However, we feel we are at a stage that we could experiment a bit with our recipe and see whether we can make it better by adding some extra spice.¬†

Ok enough with this analogy, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs actually cooking in this job post. As we are now at a hyper-growth stage, we feel that we could benefit a lot from adding to the team someone who has been an engineering lead in another company on a similar journey as ours and brings relevant experience and fresh ideas. Someone with the ability to organize a team, plan the different work-streams and own the delivery process & alignment with stakeholders, while still enjoying being close to the actual code. A person who puts the team first and is passionate about supporting people in their growth.

As a company, we believe in changing the future of work, and that's why our company expensing platform (Pleo) exists. We think that work will change to be more autonomous and flexible. Pleo is an app that delegates company spending to all employees with pre-paid cards: use your card (virtual/ physical), snap a pic of your receipt, and you're done. We take the pain away from employees having to pay out of pocket, and think that if you're going to trust an employee enough to hire them, you might as well trust them enough to spend company money sensibly. The same principles apply to how our teams are built and the type of leadership we are looking for. After all, you got to walk the talk, right? Trust, autonomy, and enablement are some of the pillars under which we operate, so we are all about servant leadership and definitely not micromanagement. We are looking for someone who cares deeply about individuals as human beings - we focus on authentic leadership and are actively trying to develop ourselves in this space. We hope that you will be able to show vulnerability, radical transparency, and a listening ear to those around you. We truly believe that with this type of style you and your team will set an incredible path forward - and that path will get us to incredible places. We want an engineering lead whose team will be standing on the top of the mountain with them - celebrating together and not left behind exhausted on the path below

If you reached this part with a smile on your face there‚Äôs a good chance you might be the one we are looking for. So maybe time to dig a bit deeper into what this role actually looks like, AKA time for bullet points.¬†

*   You know way too much about everything.
*   Take on challenges happily.
*   Probably work in IT (moms).

## Show me the benefits

*   Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
*   Ability to work remotely (anywhere between east coast of the Americas to European timezones)......
*   or onsite if you want to (Copenhagen, London, Berlin, Stockholm, Madrid)
*   Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones) The last one was in Northern Ireland last December.
*   Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets)

## And here are some other nice gestures that we do

*   Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices when you're here
*   25 days holidays (annual) + your local public holidays
*   Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company (we're talking guerrilla gardening, liquids tasting, the Pleo band, learning to code initiatives, beer brewing, skiing, that type of thing)
*   Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food etc)

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†

This world deserves the best out of trust, autonomy, automation, and empowerment.

Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote set up possible, and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps.
