## The detail

**About Omnipresent**

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re cutting this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

**Your role**

We are looking for a Payments and Fintech Specialist to join our fast growing team initially on a consulting or contracting basis. You will report into the Head of Finance to deliver this project but will also collaborate with Product/Tech and Operations throughout.

Your role will be to identify a suitable solution to facilitate incoming and outgoing, multi-currency payments. As an Employer of Record we require customer receipts to flow freely and quickly via Omnipresent to employee bank accounts, often via a local service provider, in many countries around the world. The solution's ability to integrate with accounting software and the Omnipresent platform will be imperative as will the handling of FX and reconciliation of all payable/ receivable positions. An understanding of the Fintech landscape and modern solutions to the challenges we face is a must.

*   Define requirements: Identify the needs of the business with regard to all things associated with incoming and outgoing payments including flow of funds, currency conversion, reconciliations and payable/ receivable positions.
*   Understand which pain points are “solved problems” in the world of Fintech and which need solving in a more incremental way.
*   Identify most suitable providers/solutions: Carry out a vendor selection process where your recommendation clearly addresses the business needs identified.
*   Selection: Create and present a decision making matrix explaining your suggested provider/solution.
*   Ensure the automated solution integrates with banking platforms, accounting software for invoicing and the Omnipresent platform for payroll.
*   Manage Implementation: Contribute to and project manage the solution’s implementation and integration.

**You’ve done some of these things...**

*   Devised payment strategies previously ideally for startup or Series A technology companies.
*   Lead the implementation of incoming/ outgoing payment solutions before.
*   Gained broad knowledge of the fintech tools and systems available that will facilitate the delivery of this project.
*   Collaborated with vendors, Finance and Technology teams to implement and automate processes.
*   Gained experience working with Finance teams or a good understanding of the problems to be resolved through the implementation of this solution.
*   Have Fintech Product Management or Business Analyst experience
*   Have some understanding of payroll and how it fits into the payments landscape

**You are the sort of person that...**

*   Loves to solve complex operational issues by building simple processes, identifying and using modern, online solutions to ensure a maximum degree of automation, replacing manual human interaction wherever possible.
*   Has the ability to communicate financial information to non-finance stakeholders.
*   Self-starter with a high level of motivation and determination
*   Willingness to work in a fast-paced start-up environment
