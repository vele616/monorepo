We are looking for a creative, data-driven multitasker as our first Lifecycle Marketing Specialist to engage our customers throughout their Clubhouse journey. You will be a key member of the Clubhouse Marketing team reporting to the VP of Marketing.

## What you’ll be doing:

*   Collaborate with Product Marketing and Creative to create a strategy for ongoing customer communications. 
*   Develop, execute, and optimize email and in-app campaigns, including audience segmentation, targeting, and campaign setup.
*   Analyze campaign performance and establish a reporting cadence that keeps key stakeholders in the know.
*   Help develop playbooks and best practices for using marketing automation and marketing technology platforms.

## What we’ll expect from you:

*   2+ years relevant work experience in digital marketing and analyzing campaign effectiveness for a B2B SaaS company
*   Excellent oral and written communication skills 
*   Growth mindset and relentless attention to detail 
*   Experience using marketing platforms such as Intercom, Salesforce, and Pendo

*   You’ll be working on a product built for other technology companies, with the aim of improving the lives of its users. We want and value your input as we try to keep the product moving in the right direction.
*   We expect you to work at a sustainable pace, take time off as needed, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Many of us have families and kids, so we don't work crazy hours and don't expect you to either.
