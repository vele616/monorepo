## The Challenge

The payments landscape is changing rapidly with hundreds of ways to accept payments online globally. Given the plethora of innovation in this space, payments has never been more complex for merchants to implement and maintain; similarly, e-commerce has never been more important for merchants globally.

Primer is bringing simplicity to this complex and dynamic landscape. We offer one payment infrastructure for merchants, freeing them to work with multiple providers through our one API. We will be a constant in a world where new payments methods and services are unveiled daily.

*   Conducting code reviews and continuously look at ways of improving the teams' ways of working
*   Developing deep payments expertise, always looking for ways to optimise our merchant developer experience
*   Creating detailed internal documentation for the projects you work on
