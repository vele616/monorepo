## Description

Headquartered in Helsinki with offices in Berlin, Sydney and Toronto, Aiven provides managed open-source data technologies, such as PostgreSQL, Kafka and M3, on all major clouds. We have raised $150M in VC funding to date and are backed by world-class investors including Atomico, IVP and Earlybird Venture Capital, among others. We plan to invest this funding back into open source.

Our roots are in open source. The services we provide are based on best-in-class open source data technologies. We are establishing the Open-Source Office that will coordinate and increase our contributions to the open source community.

Through Aiven, developers can do what they do best: create applications. Meanwhile, we do what we do best; manage cloud data infrastructure. We enable our customers to drive business results from open source resulting in true transformations far beyond their own backyards.

We have offices in Helsinki and Berlin, however we are hiring for this position remotely in several countries all over Europe as well.

About the role:

In Developer Relations, our goal is to help our technical user base to be successful with our platform. With that in mind, you will create written documentation, examples and tutorials with sample repositories, and blog posts. If you'd like to produce other content formats, such as video tutorials or talks, we would be pleased to support that. You will also help to target and promote the content across appropriate developer channels.

You will help to co-ordinate the production of all the resources, identifying and filling the gaps in the existing Developer Experience. You will also be reviewing and editing others' work from both within the DevRel team and from the wider technical crowd at Aiven. By bringing the knowledge of the specialists to our highly technical user base, you will enable both colleagues and customers to do their best work.

## Requirements

*   You know how to communicate complex technical concepts in a way that others can understand.
*   You have demonstrable experience of creating content, specifically for an audience of software developers.

*   You have a GitHub account and are experienced with pull request workflows and branching.

*   You're well-organised, with excellent ability for paying attention to the small details that really matter.

*   You have excellent written English skills.

*   You demonstrate empathy and enjoy removing barriers to others' success.

## Benefits

*   An agile working environment with short decision paths
*   Compensation for your open source contributions in your free time
*   Flexible working hours, including remote working when needed
*   Choose the devices and tools that make you work the best
*   Participation in employee stock option plan
*   Office snacks, soft drinks, treats and fruits
