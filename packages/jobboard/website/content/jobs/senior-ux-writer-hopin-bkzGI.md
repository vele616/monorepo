## At Hopin, we’re reimagining virtual events.

As the first all-in-one virtual venue for live online events, Hopin brings people together in a highly interactive and engaging online experience that feels just like an in-person event, only without the barriers. Whether it’s a 50-person meetup, or a 50,000-person conference—any type of event organizer can host a Hopin event for their attendees, speakers, sponsors, and vendors to convene, learn, and interact face-to-face online. We’re spearheading the innovative technology that is enabling people to gather online like never before.

Our mission is simple: **better connections for a better planet**. 

We believe in events without limits, but events that are sustainable and accessible to everyone—and fun, too! To do this, we need passionate builders and storytellers to join us. Do you love people and technology and the magic that happens when they converge at scale? Do you have the skills and experience we’re looking for to better serve our clients? If so, we’d like to meet.

We’ve been recently funded by a16z, General Catalyst, IVP, Accel, DFJ Growth, Northzone, Coatue, Tiger Global, Salesforce Ventures and many other high profile investors.

## The Role

Hopin is seeking a Senior UX Writer who is self-driven, passionate and ambitious. You will be working closely with the design and product team to create the best possible experiences for our users. You’ll be comfortable working from the macro to the micro -- from wider issues of voice and tone right down to the microcopy that aids users in their journey.

We're excited to work with someone who is proactive, highly motivated, comfortable in a rapidly changing start-up environment, and happy to work with a remote-first team. We're a team of 400+, and you will be working with a growing team of senior product designers.

**Experience comes in many forms and passion goes a long way. If your background is close to what we are looking for, please consider applying even if you can’t check every box.**

## About You

*   You write engaging and inclusive copy with a distinctive brand voice.
*   You are an effective communicator with a variety of internal and external audiences.
*   You have the ability to translate complex topics into easy to digest formats.
*   You have excellent writing, editing and proofreading skills in English (bonus points for other languages).
*   You are able to execute consistent copywriting across multiple touchpoints.
*   You enjoy working closely with and mentoring product design teams. 
*   You are able to manage multiple projects and deadlines in a fast-paced environment.
*   You have the ability to work collaboratively, and the confidence to work alone.

## What we’re looking for

*   A creative thinker who is able to translate brand and strategic needs into meaningful consumer facing copy.
*   6+ years of experience in a similar role.
*   A well rounded portfolio demonstrating creative and technical copywriting experience across a variety of brands and channels.
*   Experience writing clear narratives for B2C and B2B audiences.
*   Experience in establishing and governing UX writing guidelines and best practices.
*   Experience testing and validating copy, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

## The Offer

*   Competitive salary
*   Fully remote, global team
*   Flexible schedules
*   Laptop assigned, Mac or Dell (Windows)
*   $800 USD for Home-Office set up
*   $1500 USD for Learning & Development

At Hopin, we're committed to cultivating an environment that promotes equality, diversity, and inclusion. We are a global community and we believe our unique qualities must be celebrated as they are critical to our innovation. It's essential to us that you bring your authentic self to work every single day, no matter your age, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, neurodiversity, or otherwise. Inclusion isn't just an initiative at Hopin. We strive to embed it not just into our core values but throughout our entire ecosystem.
