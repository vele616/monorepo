## Description

We’re looking for a Trade Support Associate to join our rapidly-growing team. Vinterior is a startup that’s giving vintage a voice. In a world of mass-produced furniture, our vintage marketplace champions independent sellers across Europe and helps the world shop more sustainably.

**Who are we?**

Vinterior is on a mission to become the most loved brand for vintage. In five years, our platform has become the leading vintage marketplace in the UK – disrupting the furniture industry and building a community of design-conscious shoppers and more than 1,800 professional sellers. Sellers who we hand-pick for their expertise, and who share our obsession for craftsmanship and effortless customer service.

**What we’re looking for:**

You will be part of the Customer Experience team, dealing with our high-value professional clients. Your focus will be on offering a bespoke experience to our most important clients by providing them with pre and post-purchase support.

Vinterior’s Trade Program allows design professionals exclusive advantages such as access to trade prices, the option to reserve items, as well as tailored sourcing and procurement services.

**What you will be doing:**

*   Review in-bound trade buyer applications.
*   Contact newly registered accounts and set up phone calls to demonstrate the value of Vinterior and the Trade Program.
*   Handle any in-bound enquiry to help trade buyers with their requests and requirements as well as finding suitable options for their sourcing requests with our network of sellers.
*   Utilise data to define and understand KPIs of conversion flow and determine areas for improvement to increase business metrics.
*   Support in the development of trade sales materials.
*   Update and maintain the CRM database.

## Requirements

*   Bachelor’s Degree, Business School or Hospitality Degree is preferred.
*   Passionate about providing a great experience for clients.
*   Great listener and a solution provider.
*   Great attention to detail.
*   Good organisational and time-management skills.
*   Excellent written and verbal English.
*   Thrive under pressure.
*   General MS Office experience (Excel, Word, Powerpoint) and ability to quickly pick up new software.
*   Previous experience in customer care or project/sales coordination.
*   A second EU language is a plus.
*   An interest in vintage and antique furniture is preferable.

## Benefits

*   Great opportunities to make the role your own
*   Fast-paced environment and exciting projects
*   Flexible working
*   23 days holiday (in addition to public holidays)
*   Pension
*   Employee discount on products

**What to expect from the interview process:**

Stage 1: Short phone call.

Stage 2: Test brief where you can demonstrate your Excel or analytical skills. Response to be submitted by email.

Stage 3: Video conference with Line Manager.

Stage 4: Follow up a video conference with other members of the Operation team.

If your application ends after stage three, we’ll provide constructive feedback via email.

**Our values:**

Our interview process looks for people who share our company values.

[Please find them here](https://www.notion.so/Vinterior-ba2940b7744a4ec180b8a4d5f07c7e21).

The more these values sound like you and describe people you want to work with, the more likely you will thrive at Vinterior.

**Remote working:**

**Working hours:** We operate on British office hours, so we’re looking for people who are fully available to work during these hours.

**Stable internet connection:** This is a remote role, so please check that you have a suitable and stable internet connection before applying.

We appreciate this is a tricky time for many to navigate career changes and want to be as transparent as possible. Vinterior typically receives a high volume of applications and unfortunately, we’re unlikely to be able to respond to everyone individually about the status of your application.

Thanks for being patient and we’ll be in touch if we’re keen to take your application further. We’ll also notify all applicants once the role has been filled.

Vinterior is passionate about championing diversity and treats each application equally and respectfully.
