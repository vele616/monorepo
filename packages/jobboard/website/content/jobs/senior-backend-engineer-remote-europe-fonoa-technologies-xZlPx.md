## Description

**We are hiring fully remotely in Europe, even if you're not in the location mentioned in this role. Please ignore this as it's used for advertising purposes.**

## Engineering at Fonoa

Engineering plays a very central part in the business.

As a company with ambitions to be a world-class API solution for all things tax, we value quality over quantity when building, and we care about creating software that is scalable and maintainable, on which our customers and daily users can rely.

**Some pointers about our engineering culture:**

*   Engineers are given problems to solve, rather than features to build.
*   We always try to understand the customer's needs before thinking about implementation details.
*   Engineers are owners of their past, present and future; architecture, tools, coding, testing, deployment, operations and scaling
*   We work in lean, small teams. We co-own the product roadmap with product managers
*   We chose collaboration, compassion and trust over individualism and politics
*   We prefer innovation, constant iteration and trust over competition and perfect solutions.
*   We support each other, are kind by nature, and give as much feedback to all improve as professionals

## Products

Fonoa has a suite of API products that automate tax-related workflows for any internet company. Check them out below:

*   [Tax](https://www.fonoa.com/products/tax)
*   [Invoicing](https://www.fonoa.com/products/invoicing)
*   [Real-time Reporting](https://www.fonoa.com/products/reporting)

## Our Tech Stack

Fonoa has a suite of API products that automate tax-related workflows for any internet company. Check them out below:

*   For backend, we build in C#, .NET, Node and Go
*   For frontend, we use ReactJS and Typescript
*   For persistence we are mostly using MongoDB
*   We use Azure and AWS for our cloud services

## What you will be doing

*   Learn about how painful it is for companies to handle tax manually, and think about how our systems are changing the status quo
*   Own what you build, with the ability of deciding how to build it, and the responsibility of operating it in the production environment.
*   Build meaningful products with REST API’s that our customers use and depend on for everyday business (finance, operation, tax and developer teams)
*   Record and collate lots and lots of data sets from all these operations for long term storage and future insight
*   Use every learning and observation to improve our products, constantly

## You would be a great fit if you

*   You are fully proficient in English. Written and spoken, as we are a bunch from around the world, but we work in English.
*   You have a strong sense of ownership, you care about what you build, and that you are building the right thing that serves your customers.
*   You’re a builder at heart, you like the opportunity of having tons of exposure, making things work for a company long term, and have an entrepreneurial attitude for anything that comes your way.
*   You are either eager to learn, or comfortable scaling and operating large-scale microservices in high-growth environments.
*   You are proficient in a couple of languages, most of our current codebase is in node.js with Typescript and C#, but we are not married to any tools, we see them as a means to an end
*   You like to keep your house tidy and clean, and you just can't leave code not covered with a test. Or a feature undelivered. Or dead code rotting in production.
*   You ship, fast, continuously, and iteratively, learning on each step.
*   You like to use data over opinions to make decisions. And are ok with finding the data yourself when it’s missing.
*   You are comfortable with change, either in priorities, goals and deadlines. You see this more as an opportunity than a hurdle. You are also comfortable with challenging the status quo and pushing for change yourself.
*   You’re looking to make a serious impact, and are excited about working in a high growth startup.

## Note:

If you don’t know the technologies we use, or don’t have experience with large scale projects, but you like learning and are interested in the challenges we have, apply anyway! We are trying to build a diverse team.
