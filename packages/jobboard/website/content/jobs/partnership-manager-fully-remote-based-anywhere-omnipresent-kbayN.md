**Why?**

We are one of the fastest growing companies in the UK providing an awesome revolutionary global service.

**What?**

**About Omnipresent**

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re cutting this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

Our team is fully remote and distributed across the globe. This means you can work from anywhere our teams often take advantage of this by living a digital nomad lifestyle. We provide benefits and support in any global location just as we would for our clients and their employees.
