## About Remo

Remo is the fastest growing interactive event, marketing, and educational platform. Built to take the pain out of online events at a time when larger in-person gatherings are difficult. 

Remo has gone from a simple product with a single mission of allowing for greater interactivity for online group event interactions, to be a robust platform to host professional conferences, virtual music concerts, sponsored and custom branded events across an unlimited spectrum of industries and even to be a virtual office for those who need that service. 

Remo is a platform that people use for many different use-cases (interaction moments), where you experience that the person that you are talking to is as close to a live in-person interaction as you might get in an online world. 

Remo Conference helps creators, coaches, and event organizers create immersive online events right from your computer, within your Chrome Browser. What’s unique is users can learn and connect just like in real life. 

Remo is the first web-video platform that allows people to have face-to-face networking online just like in-person events that build meaningful relationships and conversations. 

REMO's ease of use and customizable features have made it an exciting and attractive option for events. Loved by customers and by a culture that likes to customize, it is gaining in online event hosting recognition. With major offices in Seattle, WA.

Remo is bringing a better way to gather, learn, and meet others.[Watch a video of who we are and what you will do here!](https://youtu.be/FI095y4sbMI)

A Product Designer’s Role at Remo

•    Conduct user research and synthesize results and communicate findings to your product teams.

•    Champion and teach others UX best practices to ensure we’re all making informed design decisions together.

•    Request feedback from Design Team members, assigned product team members, and other teammates around Remo through asynchronous or synchronous communication.

•    Collaborate and share work early and often. Create clickable prototypes or provide links to assets with your teams for feedback and to conduct usability testing.

•    Prioritize your design workload based on a clear understanding of the product team and company goals.

•    Deliver high quality, complete designs, and specifications for large, complex projects alongside PMs and engineers.
