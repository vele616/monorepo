## Company Overview

At Netlify, we’re building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development. Netlify currently serves more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide.

Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world. We’re ~44% woman or non-binary, and are composed of more than a fourth as many nationalities as we are team members.

We recently raised $63M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. Among our investors are Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, EQT Ventures as well as the founders of GitHub, Slack, Figma  and Yelp. This latest round brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $107M to date.

## What we're looking for

We’re looking for a user experience and design director to lead, nurture, and grow our incredible product design team. The ideal candidate is someone that has led and grown design teams, has a track record of successful mentorship, and has a design vision and skillset aligned to accelerate Netlify’s ambition of a world-class developer experience for web developers. The candidate should have demonstrable success launching and iterating world-class design experiences with their team.

This person should be a strong partner with product and engineering and should push us to constantly and consistently deliver a great user experience. The candidate should have experience in implementing and leading design processes and systems. They should be well versed and opinionated in modern design best practices, utilizing quantitative and qualitative data as part of the design process, and bring fresh ideas and methods for product design and discovery.

The ideal candidate should be passionate about injecting design thinking into our product process and has demonstrable ability doing so. They've lead initiatives like design sprints and have onboarded engineering and product teams into design-thinking processes, making it integral to the product development process. They fight for the end-user while balancing the overall product and business needs of the org. The candidate should show wins of their design teams being integral to the success of their products and companies, contributing new ideas and big product wins, and creating a system around doing so.

## About the role:

This role will oversee the product design team which includes Product and UX Designers. In this role, you will have individual contributors reporting to you. You will need to help hire and grow the team.

You should love helping your team grow and develop, taking care of their professional growth needs as well as quality of day-to-day work life, being an advocate for their work and developing a strong sense of direction.

You'll be a confident leader with the ability to facilitate conversations and decision-making within the team. You'll be responsible for setting, tracking and communicating metrics around work output and goals.

In addition to people management responsibilities, you will need to establish a hiring process for the Product design and research. You will focus on building a happy, healthy and diverse team.

You will work to help develop metrics for your function that represent their work and contributions.

You will also work closely with other managers and leaders within the organization to plan projects, schedule resourcing for those projects and identify risks.

We have a small headquarters in San Francisco but we are a largely distributed engineering team, so remote applicants are welcome. You will need to enable the team to work productively across different timezones. Fostering good habits of documentation, empathy, and integrity to deliver on committed work are some of the key elements for success on our team. Experience working and managing remote teams is a big plus.

*   Ability to hire thoughtfully and quickly.
*   Ability to develop the individual's skills and professional careers of Product Designers and researchers.
*   Can supervise work priorities and direction by collaborating with the PM and development teams.
