## Who are we?

We are Invisible’s Technologies Team. We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen. How?

## We Believe That

\-- Invisible is a world-changing company and the Technologies Team is responsible for creating the systems that will launch Invisible into the stratosphere

\-- Exponential gains from systems > Short term linear work > Systems for system's sake

\-- Consistent feedback is key - we are addicted to learning and getting better

\-- What one of us knows, all of us should know

\-- Every new mistake is a learning opportunity

## Because of these beliefs, we’ve built a team where

\-- Distributed approaches and centralized intelligence merge. Each teammate is constantly innovating and trying something new. Every mistake is prevented by all. Every success is learned by all.

\-- Each of us contains the sum of the knowledge, intelligence, and creativity of our entire team.

\-- We evolve and mutate constantly like an organism, identifying successful and problematic tactics and incorporating ideas from any source.

Invisible is a meritocracy and a startup. There’s plenty of responsibilities to go around. You’ll be expected to absorb responsibilities whenever you see them and figure out how to abstract yourself away from the job—be your own mini-CEO. Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will directly impact how successful we are as a company.

You’ll also have the opportunity to be part of the product development. Our product work is done by squads: product manager, designers, customers, and an engineer like you, focused on solving a customer problem. Together, your squad will have the autonomy to own key parts of our roadmap and build the things that will have the greatest impact on solving customer problems.
