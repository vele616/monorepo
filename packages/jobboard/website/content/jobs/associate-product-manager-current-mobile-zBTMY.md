## What is Current?

Our mission is to enable budget-conscious consumers to earn additional income from their everyday habits. We accomplish this with [an Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.current.android) and [smartphone](https://modephone.com/) that pay users to listen to music, charge their phone, play games, and complete surveys. Our products also connect users with exclusive deals to help them save and earn even more.

We doubled the size of our product team in the past year. Over 270,000 people across the world earn on Current daily, we’ve paid out over $1M to people in the past few months, and we’re operating at an 8-figure revenue run rate. In the past year, we’ve significantly improved user retention and revenue and are expanding our world-class product team to continue fueling our growth.

Our product team is 30 people strong and is made up of cross-functional pods that own specific areas of Current. Each pod has a Product Manager, Engineers, and a Designer, and together, they rally around their pillar of Current. They are responsible for solving the hardest problems our users and business face and delivering great product experiences. Our team members are constantly pushing each other to grow and take every opportunity to learn from each other. At the same time, each team member has full ownership over their work and is a leader on their team.

Current was started by two founders, Dan and Kiran, who have a track record of building successful companies and growing amazing teams. Everyone at Current embodies our core values such as pushing the boundaries, taking ownership, asking questions, and bringing a sense of humor.

## About the role

As an Associate Product Manager (APM), you’ll help your product team execute well and ship great product experiences. You’ll work closely with the Product Manager as well as Engineering, Design, and Marketing to translate complex business problems into simple solutions that our team builds.

During your time, you’ll get hands-on experience with a breadth of product work. The types of work you’ll be involved in will depend on the product team you join but all of our teams solve problems that touch engagement, user experience, ad tech, and monetization. You’ll receive constant mentorship, guidance, and management from a Product Manager who will work with you to grow your product and leadership skills.

Within a year of joining as an APM, you’ll be expected to grow into a Product Manager role where you’ll lead a dedicated product team, define the team’s strategies and roadmap, and help the team execute well. Your time as an APM will follow two main  to help you get there:

## Months 0 - 6 | Product Execution

This period is all about getting to know Current and helping your team execute smoothly. You’ll find yourself:

*   **Learning the details of Current**. You’ll spend your first few weeks working on various teams at Current and understanding our culture, product strategy, and processes. Then, you’ll eventually settle on a single team for the duration of your APM program.
*   **Gathering and sharing product requirements.** You’ll work with your PM to review Product Briefs, break them down into User Stories, and share with the Engineers on your team.
*   **Preparing and helping run sprints.** Current builds software in 2-week sprints. You’ll work with your Engineers to estimate and update your User Stories, break them down, and group them into achievable workloads for 2 weeks. You’ll work closely with your team’s Engineers to find and resolve issues quickly to ensure a smooth release.

## Months 6 - 12 | Customer Insight and Experimentation

Once your team is running smoothly, your responsibility will grow. You’ll begin spending more time on understanding our customers’ needs, measuring product performance, and evaluating the impact of your team’s work. You’ll find yourself:

*   **Conducting user surveys and interviews.** You’ll work with your PM to design and conduct surveys and interviews. You’ll understand how customers engage with Current and use this information to inform product decisions.
*   **Designing and running product experiments.** You’ll familiarize yourself with the science of A/B testing and will learn to use our data tools. This will allow you to design and run experiments to measure the impact of your team’s initiatives.
*   **Guiding your team’s strategy, priorities and roadmap.** You’ll use your newfound customer insight to have input on your team’s strategy, priorities, and longer term roadmap, which you’ll communicate to your team.

## Months 12+ | Graduation

Once you ‘graduate’ from the program, you’ll become a full-fledged Product Manager at Current. Your responsibility will continue to grow and change throughout your time here!

The Associate Product Manager role is a full-time contract position with the intention of converting you into a full-time (W2) employee as a Product Manager by the end of the program. This position is a remote position and would follow the timezone of our company headquarters (Chicago, CST, GMT-6). During the contract period, the annualized salary will be $50-65k USD, depending on location and experience.
