DNSFilter was born out of necessity. Our founders realized that the existing solutions for DNS security out there were clunky, convoluted, and overpriced. In 2015, they set out on a simple yet crucial mission—to revolutionize DNS security. We’ve come a long way since our humble beginnings. We support nearly 14,000 organizations, including Fortune 500 customers like NVIDIA, and provide service to millions of end-users. Our infrastructure is made up of two anycast networks with over 300 servers in 53 datacenters. At the start of 2020, our software was processing 1B queries/day. One year later, we’re now processing 12B queries/day! In the middle of a global pandemic, our team (and product) thrived. We doubled the size of our team, and we’re looking to do it all over again in 2021.

To accelerate our growth, we are looking for an experienced VP of Sales to build and lead a high-performance sales team, set sales goals and forecast SaaS revenue and to build out our sales operations engine. The ideal candidate has scaled revenue in SaaS organizations from $5m to $30m+ ARR, including implementing the processes, tools, culture and playbooks to support predictable, efficient growth.

The VP of Sales reports directly to our CEO and is a key part of our executive team.

**You will:**

*   Own all new, expansion and renewal revenue
*   Define and implement strategies and plans that support the achievement of our revenue goals
*   Recruit and manage a team of world-class sales professionals
*   Create territories, quotas & compensation plans to help support the achievement of our goals and targets
*   Create an accountable, data-driven culture. Report revenue results to the company, executive leadership and the board
*   Develop relationships with Marketing, Finance, Customer Support, Product, and Engineering teams to maximize opportunities for positive collaboration that support our revenue growth

*   Create forward-looking departmental plans to support our future growth targets

**Success in This Role is Measured By:**

*   Setting and meeting aggressive growth targets for new, expansion and renewal revenue
*   Providing accurate forecasts and forward-looking targets
*   Building, managing and leading a team of high-performing sales professionals to ensure predictable, forecastable goal attainment

**You have:**

*   5-10 years sales leadership experience, managing high-performing teams who consistently meet & exceed quota
*   Previous experience building and scaling sales organizations from early-stage to at least $25m ARR
*   Experience in SaaS sales within the security industry, or related field
*   An entrepreneurial mindset and enjoy solving complex problems
