ArangoDB is an open-source, highly scalable Graph Database with Multi-Model capabilities. In addition to graph it is natively supporting a number of data-models including document, and key-value as well as Full-Text Search and Retrieval. It serves as the scalable backbone for Graph-Analytics and complex data architectures across many different industries. Developers can build high-performance applications using a convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions. ArangoDB itself is written in C++, but a lot of our tools surrounding it are written in Go. Oh, and did we mention it is open source?

We are looking for an experienced Golang Engineer to work on various ArangoDB database integrations and tools, including our Kubernetes Operator. Our goal is to make working with data easy. And because we want to make it simpler for others, we have to work on solving complex problems like the simple deployment of ArangoDB in cluster environments.

Our headquarter ArangoDB Inc. is in San Francisco (US), our secondary location is in Cologne (Germany) and our diverse team includes workmates at remote locations worldwide. So do you prefer your desk at home or do you want to join our team at one of our locations? Your choice.

## About the Role:

*   You help with the design, development and maintenance of our tools around ArangoDB that are written in Golang
*   You build and improve our Kubernetes operator to run and deploy our ArangoDB database
*   Work closely with Customer Care to provide technical support and integrate client feedback into the product life cycle
*   You help produce user guides and documentation in cooperation with Marketing
*   Help the open source community and our clients with best practice

## Your Skills:

*   Golang and ideally Kubernetes is your thing and you feel at home in the Open Source world surrounding it
*   You have hands-on experience developing for and working with large scale distributed systems
*   Development experience with more than one programming language, including Go

The over 60 minds of ArangoDB come from 4 different continents and over a dozen countries. Diverse backgrounds enable us to see new solutions. We love this diversity and encourage everyone who is curious and visionary to join the multi-model movement.
