## About BMAT

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, Tel-Aviv, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.

## Our Culture

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

## Job Summary

As part of the Digital team, you will help build and improve one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We are connected to more than 50 service providers such as Spotify or Apple Music. The sales reports they provide us are ingested in a scalable platform that allows us to efficiently process billions of music transactions each year.

As a Client Manager, you will lead and maintain the relationship with our Digital customers, understanding their needs and giving them responsive support on a daily basis. You will need excellent account management skills, engaging with clients and ensuring excellent customer services provided through your technical skills.

You will work side by side with the technical team in order to offer the best user experience for our clients and develop creative solutions to satisfy their business needs.

This role can be performed in any location within the EMEA region.

## What you will do

*   Perform a transversal role, working in tasks related to Client, Product and Project management.
*   Establish daily communications with the customers (mainly DSP, CMOs, publishers) to coordinate and solve incidences.
*   Collect Customers’ requirements and translate them to the engineering team.
*   Understand the technical capabilities of the tools and the team and translate them to our customers.
*   Preserve the trust gained with the customer and be the responsible for bridging the gap between them and the engineering team.

## All About You

*   You are eager to learn and have an instinct for listening, asking, understanding and communicating.
*   You love speaking with clients and solving problems.
*   You get the most out of your time when working in a team.
*   You are passionate about music and have previous experience (or strong interest) in the Music Industry. A previous experience as a technical account manager or technical customer support would be a plus.
*   Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in International Business, Music Business or similar.
*   Bachelor’s degree in Telecom Engineering, Computer Science, Audio Visual Engineering or similar is a big plus.
*   Fluent in English (any other language is a plus).

## You Can Enjoy  

*   Remote working and flexibility on working hours.
*   Flat hierarchy.  
*   Free English and Spanish classes.
*   Wide range of online and onsite courses.
*   Possibility to choose your hardware and tools.  
*   Becoming part of a young and international team based in Barcelona obsessed with bettering the music industry.

Diverse perspectives bring drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.
