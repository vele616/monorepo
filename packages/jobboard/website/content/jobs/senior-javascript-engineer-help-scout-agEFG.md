JavaScript powers the magic behind [Help Scout’s](https://www.helpscout.com/) apps and services, bringing them to life with delightful interactions and dynamic real-time updates. Your work as an experienced Javascript Front-end Engineer will empower over 10,000 customer-centric businesses provide excellent service to people in the most human and helpful way, and will support the other senior engineers on your team.

## Tools we use

*   React, Redux, CSS, Jest and Cypress are your tools of choice though you are capable of working with Backbone/Marionette and Sass while we continue to transition our remaining applications to React.
*   You will work with, and contribute to, our very own component-based [design system](https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react).
*   In your day-to-day you will use tools like Slack, Jira, GitHub, Docker, Drone.io and Jenkins.

## About the role

*   The engineering team is made up of about 50 people, most of whom work in one of 3 small cross-functional teams. These teams contain all the back-end and front-end talent to deliver exciting new capabilities.  You will be a Front-end Engineer working on the Docs Team. You will be collaborating with a dedicated designer, product manager, a Front-end Engineer, and  a Back-end engineer.
*   Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to [remote, agile development](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/). When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review using video and screen-sharing as needed. We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.
*   You’ll work with six other full-time JavaScript/ front-end engineers to maintain and improve Help Scout’s JS/ CSS standards and best practices. You’ll work with a design team with strong technical capabilities who are focused on creating scalable design systems and developing reusable interactive components across our projects. You will have the opportunity to contribute to these frameworks and other open source projects.   
*   Everything is secondary to the _customer experience_. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.
*   You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.
*   You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).

## About you

*   You have a love for design and are at your best partnering with designers to bring a project to life. You take designs created using Storybook and Figma components and transform them into fully-functioning production-ready code, making sure every pixel and interaction is perfect and up to spec.  You like owning the quality of the code you write — QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. 
*   You became an engineer because you like writing software that helps people.
*   You are a skilled, passionate, and humble engineer who is friendly, collaborative, and supportive. 
*   You value personal growth and constructive feedback. Believing that“a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team. 
*   You demonstrate an empathetic, organized and collaborative communication style with fellow engineers and non-engineering stakeholders. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours. 
*   Your code is a pleasure for your teammates to read and easily understood. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.
*   You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea.  You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work style to be remote-friendly.  

**Bonus points if you** 

*   Have worked with PHP, and are excited to learn more!
*   Have a love making a designers vision come to life.
*   Are interested in building inclusive, accessible websites.

About Us

[Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/) is made by roughly 110 people in 80+ cities around the world, all with a passion for helping others. We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences. Help Scout launched in 2011 and today we have more than 10,000 paying customers in 140+ countries.

Why Help Scout?

**We're remote.** It doesn’t matter if you’ve worked remotely before — we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and are [helping to write the playbook](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remote-culture/) — we’re happy to show you the ropes. Most folks that get a taste of working in a "remote first" company have a hard time going back to the old way of doing things.

**We’re passionate about diversity and inclusion.** The data is abundantly clear about diverse teams being more successful, and we're dedicated to setting the team up for success. Today our leadership team is 62% women, and that's just the start. Here's our [DEI Dashboard](https://www.helpscout.com/dei/) where you can see all of our team demographic data and read about our commitment to this work.

**We're committed to SMBs for the long term.** Help Scout is focused entirely on serving small and midsize businesses, typically up to 500 employees, because those companies view customer service differently. It's not a cost to be optimized, it's their most effective marketing tool and a key differentiator from the competition. We built Help Scout for companies that truly _value_ being customer-centric (like us) and want a product that shares their values.

**We're leaving the world better than we found it.** Did you know Help Scout is a certified B Corporation, with a mission to give away at least 1% of our product through [Help Scout for Good](https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/)? Our company exists not just to help ourselves, but to invest in our team, our customers, our community, and our environment.

Our commitment to you

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates [diversity and inclusion](https://www.helpscout.com/blog/diversity-inclusion-2019/). We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We have read the studies and understand that diverse teams build better products, bring more perspective to the table, contribute to a company’s financial success and help foster a more inclusive environment for all employees, but the bottom line is that it's the right thing to do.
