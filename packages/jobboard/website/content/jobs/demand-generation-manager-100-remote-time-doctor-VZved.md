You’ll work closely with our sales teams to execute and monitor campaigns, partner with ad agencies on our advertising, and partner with other members of the marketing team to execute integrated campaigns.

*   Lead nurturing: Own the strategy for HubSpot email nurtures, workflows, segmented lists, campaign assets, and reporting.
*   Reporting: Monitor performance of advertising and integrated campaigns, always ensuring that we keep within budget.
