## Description

Interested in joining a start-up that champions independent vintage furniture design? A company where "sustainability" is not just a marketing term - but something that’s at the heart of the business model. Do you have a passion for interior and design trends as well as the wider zeitgeist?

Vinterior is on a mission to become the most loved brand for vintage-lovers across the globe. In less than four years, we have become the leading vintage marketplace in the UK. With a community of over 1,800 vintage sellers that power 180,000 vintage products on the platform.

We are currently seeking a talented UX Designer to contribute to the design space in our product team and help us shape a first-class experience for our buyers and sellers.

**About the Product team:**

We’re currently a team of 9, comprising of 1 Senior Product Designer, 5 Full Stack Engineers, 2 Senior Full Stack Engineers and the Head of Engineering.

We love to experiment and are currently working in 6 week cycles similar to the process documented in the book "_Shape up_" by Basecamp.

**What you will do?**

*   Take broad, conceptual ideas and shape them into something valuable that can be delivered within a 6-week cycle.
*   Design flows and experiences that are incredibly simple and meet our brand guidelines.
*   Contribute to uncover what a great product design and development process looks like at Vinterior.
*   Help to raise an awareness, understanding and appreciation of design at Vinterior.
*   Contributing to small cross functional squads (engineering, marketing, customer experience) working on product initiatives from idea until launch.

## Requirements

*   3+ years of experience as a UX or UI designer.
*   Ability to own the design process end-to-end from conception to implementation.
*   Ability to plan and conduct user research and usability testings in a remote environment.
*   Solid visual design skills.
*   Proficiency with design and prototyping tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch)
*   A strong understanding of user interaction patterns and design industry standards.
*   Excellent communication and writing skills.
*   Ability to clearly articulate design decisions.
*   Experience working with engineers, product owners and others members of cross-functional teams.
*   Ability to decide and create appropriate design deliverables for each stage of the design and development process.
*   Experience designing experiences that span across multiple devices.
*   Online portfolio which showcases your UX design process and visual design flair.
*   Ability to give and receive constructive and actionable feedback.

**Bonus if you have any of the following:**

*   Experience working with design systems
*   Previous experience in the retail space
*   Worked in a startup
*   Worked in a remote team

**The process**

Please send us your resume.

You can expect to hear back from us within roughly 1 to 2 weeks.

We will organise a few calls to talk you through the role and learn more about you and your experience. The calls will be with our Head of Engineering and a Senior Product Designer.

Finally, there will be a culture and values assessment with one of our Founders and our Head of Engineering.

If all goes well we will make an offer to you as soon as possible.

## Benefits

*   Training budget for workshops, online training, conferences etc.
*   Book library (physical and Audible) for all employees.
*   31 days holiday a year (incl. UK bank holidays). Unpaid leave is also available.

*   Employee discount on products.
*   3 days to dedicate to your own learning every cycle (2 months)
*   We regularly hold knowledge-sharing sessions within the team.

**Remote working**

Our team is spread across Europe but being remote does not mean being isolated, we communicate every day, so you will not feel alone! We operate under British office times and we expect you to be able to work UK office hours.
