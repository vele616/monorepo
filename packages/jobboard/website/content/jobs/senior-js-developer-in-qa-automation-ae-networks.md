### About
We are a team of 6 spread across few timezones and represent the QA automation team at A+E Networks (History, Lifetime).
We are on a mission to make our client's apps quality process as good as possible and as automated as possible
so there is less human intervention and apps regularly get 5 stars on app stores!
We do write e2e tests, but we also build platforms, interface with 3rd party systems, build tools, methodologies and best practices for
quality of applications inside client's company.

**What we are looking for:**
- A Croatia (or EE region) based senior level JS developer with a "QA/testing" and automation mindset.
- 6+ Years of professional experience
- At least one year of remote work experience
- A team player and a great colleague
- Someone who is open to do some different type of software development rather than writing features in React and creating APIs in Node to consume them.
- Some who does not mind writing tests for a day, researching for a feature or a tool tomorrow and building a distributed testing runner in the Cloud the next week
- Someone who likes to automate everything they can
- Appium/Detox or any e2e testing tools and AWS exposure is a major plus

**What we offer:**
- Challenging and diverse work in automation and QA realm (no manual testing!)
- Work in a one of the most interesting IT areas today - Video Streaming on all major platforms!
- Competitive pay
- Long term work and advancement opportunities
- Colleagues from Croatia
- (Semi) Flexible work hours - no need to work US times (very close to Croatia work hours)
- Low stress (virtual) work environment 

### Notes:
- This is a *remote* contract position for long term work, not employment 
- The candidate needs to have a legal entity to issue invoices to the client
- There are no extra benefits nor working equipment included, the contractor is expected to provide their own (specialized equipment, if needed, will be provided)
