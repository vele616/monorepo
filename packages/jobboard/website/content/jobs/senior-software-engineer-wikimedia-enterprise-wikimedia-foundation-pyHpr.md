## Senior Software Engineer

## Summary

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our team, reporting to Product Manager. As the Senior Software Engineer, you will be a core member of the Wikimedia Enterprise engineering team and will contribute heavily to some of the high impact challenges behind innovating, building, and maintaining Wikipedia’s data feeds for high volume reusers. You will also be a leader in the long term strategy of the project, working with tech leadership to propose infrastructure that meets goals of our movement and the needs of our customers. In this role, you will become an expert on AWS and the tradeoffs of different infrastructure setups for short and long term sustainability of large scale data products. You will work directly with tech and product leadership to craft strategy, and directly with the engineering team to build better software that will meet requirements from our customers.

We are a distributed and diverse team of engineers with a drive to explore, experiment, and embrace new technologies. We act sort of like a startup within the Wikimedia Foundation: we build quickly, deploy often, and our work has a very high impact on the global knowledge ecosystem.

If you are up to the challenge of working on something fast paced, of creating services that will revolutionize the systems distributing our knowledge for billions of people across the world, and enjoy the idea of working with a globally distributed team, you might be just the person we need.

## You are responsible for:

*   Bringing your creativity to improve our current infrastructure
*   Being a key part of planning our future technical roadmap
*   Maintaining and improving the reliability of highly used commercial data feeds 
*   Supporting new code/feature deployments
*   Troubleshooting, debugging and following-up on emerging issues in our application stack and its surroundings
*   Being the interface between the Wikimedia Foundation’s SRE team and Wikimedia Enterprise
*   Assisting in the architectural design of new services and making them operate at scale
*   Incident response, diagnosis and follow-up on system outages or alerts across Wikimedia Enterprise’s production infrastructure
*   Sharing our values and work in accordance with them

## Skills and Experience:

*   3+ years experience in an SRE/Operations/DevOps role as part of a team
*   Being comfortable working in a semi-ambiguous environment, similar to that of a startup
*   Experience in supporting complex web applications running on Amazon Web Services or other comparable cloud platforms
*   Experience working with Kafka or similar distributed event processing systems
*   Experience working with Nodejs and Go applications
*   Comfortable with configuration management and orchestration tools (ECS, Kubernetes), and modern observability infrastructure (monitoring, metrics and logging)
*   Aptitude for automation and streamlining of tasks
*   Comfortable with shell and scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (e.g. Python, Go, Bash, Ruby, etc.)
*   Good understanding of Linux/Unix fundamentals and debugging skills
*   Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team
*   B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science or equivalent in related work experience

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   Track record of open source contributions is highly appreciated
*   Experience with non-cloud hosted infrastructure
*   Startup experience is a plus
*   Remote work experience with a highly distributed team

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:
