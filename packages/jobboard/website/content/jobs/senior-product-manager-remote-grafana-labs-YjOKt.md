**About Grafana Labs:**

There are more than 700,000 active installations of Grafana around the globe, monitoring everything from beehives to climate change in the Alps. The instantly recognizable dashboards have been spotted everywhere from a SpaceX launch and Minecraft HQ to Wimbledon and the Tour de France. Grafana Labs also helps companies including Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, and eBay manage their observability strategies with full-stack offerings that can be run fully managed with Grafana Cloud, or self-managed with Grafana Enterprise Stack. The Grafana stack has grown to include two other open-source projects, Grafana Loki (for logs) and Grafana Tempo (for traces)

**About the role:**

As a Product Manager at Grafana Labs, you'll be involved with everything related to our products. You will be expected to be a “subject matter expert” on customer’s needs and problems when representing customers to engineering and highly technically proficient when representing the products to customers. 

As the “bridge” between the engineering and commercial sides of the company, you should act as a facilitator, connecting the engineering and commercial organisations and ensuring the free flow of information.  The teams and people you will be interacting with will be mostly remote/distributed, so strong and proactive communication is essential.

Across Grafana Labs, you will work closely with the engineering teams, UX team and Solutions Engineering to collect, curate and represent our customers’ problems and feedback, both from the community and our paying customers. As part of the Grafana Cloud team you will focus on our Cloud story and own the roadmaps, collateral and market research. You will help the engineering team gather evidence to support various tradeoffs and priorities and communicate to our users when they can expect new features and improvements.

Working closely with the Commercial Team, you will be responsible for producing presentations and documentation around upcoming features, their potential for commercial differentiation, and our roadmaps.

We like to start small, test and iterate. By measuring the impact, we learn and drive innovation. We believe you like to work this way as well. If you're passionate about metrics, observability and distributed systems, and want to work with open source, this job is for you.

## Requirements:

*   Above all else, you would like to play a big part in significantly growing user engagement and retention.
*   You are comfortable working in a remote-first company; communication is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind and respectful. We operate by consensus, you can contribute to a discussion but then commit to the team decision.
*   You have at least 5+ years experience in Product Management, including in B2B SaaS software. You'll work with the 60+ strong Grafana Cloud team on a product that will be used by engineers all over the world.
*   You have a good understanding of a software development process that takes a user-centered approach. You easily build an understanding of the users’ context and goals which will help you propose the right solution that brings the biggest value to them.
*   You know how to transform ideas and feedback into a roadmap – you are able to understand the users' problems and translate them into clear requirements. You are able to communicate the requirements clearly in written and spoken English.
*   You enjoy diving into complex solutions – Grafana Cloud is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and care deeply about their workflows.
*   You have an active interest or experience in monitoring and want to bring access to observability to everyone.
*   You have experience and a passion for building a product management practice, by formalizing good product management processes and mentoring/growing a team of product managers.
