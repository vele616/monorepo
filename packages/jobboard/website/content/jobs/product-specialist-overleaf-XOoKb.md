## Description

Overleaf is looking for an outstanding Product Specialist to help us continue to provide first-class support to our growing community, focused on providing timely first responses to support queries, and supporting other customer-facing functions including sales, marketing, and accounts.

This is a remote, full-time role, ideally based in the UK, EU, or the Eastern time zone of the US.

## Who we are

Overleaf is a startup and social enterprise that builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.

Overleaf has seen rapid adoption across science and research, and now supports a community of over seven million users worldwide. This community includes major institutions such as Stanford and Caltech, with Overleaf becoming an integral part not only of research collaborations but also of undergraduate teaching. Many large international tech companies and labs use our enterprise solutions, and we work with several major publishers: for example, supporting collaboration on IEEE’s member platform, and making the journal submission process smoother for LaTeX users across many academic publishers.

Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of forty, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US. We were recently recognised as one of the [UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses) and as the [Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner) in the 2020 SaaS awards Program

## How we work

Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. Our main office is located in London, UK, and we aim to get the whole team together in London a couple of times a year for face-to-face time, Coronavirus permitting.

We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time.

## About this role

Product specialists sit within the Support team, providing support to end users as part of our support rotation which covers (nearly) all time zones. Your main focus will be supporting individual end-users of Overleaf.

This is a junior role, involving following established procedures to help the team provide outstanding support. In particular, you would:

*   Triage the end-user support queue following established procedures, providing timely responses to support queries.
*   Provide basic product support via email.
*   Follow established procedures to support other customer facing functions, including sales, marketing, and accounts.
*   Use established procedures to ensure that customer feedback makes it back into our roadmapping process.
*   Write and update documentation to help our customers self-support where possible.
*   Regularly attend team meetings, and provide and receive feedback to team members.

As product specialist you will have the opportunity to interact with multiple customer segments including corporate, government, academic institutions and scholarly publishers. In addition to working with multiple product groups within the Overleaf team, you will have the chance to interact with the broader portfolio of Digital Science products and solutions.

As Overleaf is a fast-growing company, there will also be opportunities for the person hired for this position to grow and develop, and to take on additional responsibility, if desired.

## How we hire

The stages in our hiring process are typically:

*   We will aim to update you on the status of your application within one week from when we receive it.
*   We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.
*   We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is practical. For the practical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or doing an exercise during the interview, if you prefer. The exercises are practical in nature, and you can use Google, etc., and ask us questions.
*   We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.
*   If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.

## Requirements

We require that you:

*   work for us full time (or nearly full time)
*   will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm - 5pm UK time
*   travel occasionally, to meet with colleagues
*   be available for an infrequent (10x/yr) weekend call rotation
*   have excellent written English — most of our support is conducted via email.
*   are polite and professional — these are some of our [core values](https://www.overleaf.com/about/values).
*   maintain commercial awareness — you will be interacting with our customers and potentially involved in pre-sales discussions.
*   have a basic familiarity with Overleaf and LaTeX
*   be able to use communication and collaboration tools such as Slack, Front, Google Meet, and Google Docs..
*   have the ability to work in a remote environment, and complete assigned tasks within the time allotted.

The following skills are desirable (but not required):

*   Presenting to groups via web conference

## Benefits

This is a paid, full-time position. You can work from anywhere, ideally based in either the UK or EU or the Eastern time zone of the US, and salary will be based on experience. Benefits include:

*   Remote and flexible working.
*   You would join a small, dedicated, and growing team.
*   We're part of Digital Science (https://www.digital-science.com/) and backed by Bethnal Green Ventures (https://bethnalgreenventures.com/), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.
*   You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.
*   We provide a training budget; many of our staff choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.
*   We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
