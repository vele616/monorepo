## Description

## Who are we?

Kuali builds software solutions for higher education. We help our customers — colleges & universities — focus on providing a fantastic education to students by decreasing their administrative costs. We work in a competitive space, ripe for innovation, with users ready to be delighted.

Our culture

As a company, we are guided by our [cultural values](https://www.kuali.co/jobs#values):

*   Iterate to evolve
*   Cultivate openness
*   Act with accountability
*   Assume the best
*   Practice humility
*   Deliver amazing experiences
*   Make mistakes

As team members at Kuali, we learn from and teach each other, we practice transparency and empathy, and we delight in delivering value to our customers.

We work remotely, and have for years. Distributed work is in our bones, with a history of institutions working across state lines on open-source software for more than ten years. Our employees each work in the environment where they’re happiest, from Pennsylvania to Hawaii. We work consciously to create a collaborative and healthy remote work culture, and we travel to meet in person a few times each year.

**Everyone should love their work.**

Kuali has been voted a [top place to work](https://topworkplaces.com/publication/saltlake/kuali/) for 3 years in a row by the Salt Lake Tribune. We also made [Forbes' list of America's Best Startup Employers](https://www.forbes.com/americas-best-startup-employers/#1100e1e65275) for 2020. Not too shabby.

## Your team

You will be part of the Kuali Financials team, working closely with Customer Success colleagues, who are focused on helping customers get the most value from their investment in our software, and the team-members who design and build our products. Customers use our Financials product to efficiently and effectively manage the complex accounting needs of higher education.

## Who are you?

We’re looking for curious, enthusiastic, empathetic team members to solve problems, execute on ideas, advocate for the customer, and contribute to a team culture built on trust and mutual respect. As a Customer Support Specialist here, you’ll contribute to our goal of delighting the people who use our software. You’ll do this by being responsive to our customers when they have questions about how best to use our software, run into issues they need help with, and documenting our best practices. Your communication skills and ability to build lasting relationships with these clients will ensure they have everything they need to have a great experience using our software. You take what you learn from working with our customers and share that with the entire team in order to improve our product.

We believe the best products are created by teams who represent a broad range of ideas and perspectives. We value employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

## Requirements

## Other things you should know:
