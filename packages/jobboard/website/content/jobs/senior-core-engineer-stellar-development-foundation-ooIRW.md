As a member of our team, you'll have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of problems focused on growing and scaling our global network. This includes inventing semantics to enable new possibilities for participants of the network, writing features that promote the growth of our peer to peer network of validators, facilitating scalability towards fast and reliable transactions, and keeping the network protected against bad actors across a wide variety of security vectors.

## In this role, you will:

*   Design and build key components of Stellar Core - the backbone software behind the Stellar Network.

*   Collaborate on new architectures and subsystems, working alongside our CTO, our team of engineers, and our community of open source developers.
*   Write clean, maintainable code with an emphasis on edge case analysis and future-proofing our work.
*   Own core subsystems of Stellar Core, and help the team hit critical product milestones.

*   Investigate and refactor performance bottlenecks in order to continue scaling the system.
*   Author detailed technical feature and protocol (RFC) specifications - we take design seriously, and we encourage everyone to be a part of our RFC processes.

## You have:

*   You have 4+ years of experience developing software on a team.
*   You have a BS or MS in Computer Science or equivalent field.
*   You excel in writing code in C++ 11, especially in a production environment.
*   You're a great communicator that can advocate and lead technical discussions, especially during the design and code review process.
*   You have a solid understanding of software design patterns, and how to build components that are reusable, extensible, and modular.
*   You are knowledgeable of best practices and development tools and are passionate about technological innovation.
*   You have a passion for performance debugging and benchmarking.
*   You love a good challenge in an ever-evolving space - many of the challenges we face are being faced for the first time!
*   You're enthusiastic about working on a small, growing team where you'll be given a lot of autonomy.
*   You're open, empathetic, and care about putting the best ideas forward in a collaborative and helpful manner.

## Bonus points if:

*   You have direct experience with designing and implementing distributed systems.
