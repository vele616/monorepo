## Staff Site Reliability Engineer, Infrastructure Foundations

## Summary

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to join our team, reporting to the Engineering Manager of the Infrastructure Foundations team. As the Site Reliability Engineer, you will be responsible for ensuring our global top-15 web site, our public facing services, and underlying infrastructure are healthy and developing further in support of Wikimedia’s mission.

We operate [AS 14907](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/14907) out of multiple data centers in the US, Europe, and Asia, with a global backhaul network and an open peering policy. We apply software engineering practices in our operations, and we publish all of our [documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Network_design), [code](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/operations/software/homer) and [configuration](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/operations/homer/public.git) as open source.

We are a globally distributed and diverse team of engineers with a drive to explore, experiment and embrace new technologies. If you find what we do interesting, if you are up to the challenge of improving the reliability and delivery of one of the Internet’s top 15 websites, and you enjoy the idea of working in a remote-first role, we may just be the right place for you.

## You are responsible for:

*   Design, install and administer the global networking infrastructure, including edge, backbone & core network routing, data center access layer switching and network security
*   Design and implement routing policies, VLAN topologies, and IP addressing plans
*   Investigate and troubleshoot unexpected network and/or systems issues, including routine traffic engineering and DDoS detection, mitigation and prevention
*   Manage and implement peering relationships
*   Maintain and integrate with data in our single source of truth system (Netbox), and code and configuration in our configuration management tools
*   Assist in the design and integration of virtual networks for containers and virtualization
*   Assist in or lead incident response, diagnosis and follow-up on system outages or alerts across Wikimedia’s production infrastructure
*   Mentor peers in your areas of technical and operational strength
*   Share our [values](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Values) and work in accordance with them

## Skills and Experience:

*   5+ years experience in an SRE/Operations/DevOps role as part of a team
*   Hands-on experience configuring routers and switches (we use primarily Juniper gear)
*   Solid understanding of standard switching and routing protocols and technologies (BGP, OSPF/ISIS, VRRP, VXLAN)
*   Experience designing and configuring data center access layer topologies
*   Experience with complex global routing topologies
*   Experience with shell and scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (Python, Go, Bash, etc.), and configuration management tools (Puppet, Ansible, etc.)
*   History of automating tasks and processes, identifying process gaps and finding automation opportunities
*   Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team
*   B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science or equivalent work experience

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Past experience with free/open source software development, or being part of an open source community
*   Past experience with Linux systems engineering and/or software engineering
