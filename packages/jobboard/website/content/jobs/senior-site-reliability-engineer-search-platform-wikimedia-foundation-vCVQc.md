## Senior Site Reliability Engineer

## Summary

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Senior Site Reliability Engineer to join our team, reporting to the Search Platform Engineering Manager. As the Senior Site Reliability Engineer, you will be responsible for supporting, maintaining and extending [Wikidata Query Service](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service) (WDQS), the essential infrastructure that supports querying [Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata) and our [Search infrastructure](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Search), powering the searchbox on Wikipedias and other higher level features.

The [Search Platform team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Search_Platform) is dedicated to “help people easily discover knowledge on Wikipedia and its sister projects by providing tools and infrastructure for casual readers and expert users with precise needs, while maintaining a strong emphasis on privacy.” We are a mixed-skill team composed of software engineers, a computational linguist, and a site reliability engineer. We are responsible for [Search](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Search) and the Wikidata Query Service. We are a fully remote team, [spread across UTC-8 to UTC+1 timezones](https://people.wikimedia.org/~tjones/tz/). When the world is not locked down by a pandemic, we see each other in person two or three times per year.

Wikidata Query Service is a [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) [endpoint](https://query.wikidata.org/), backed by a graph database (more precisely an RDF Triple Store) that is live updated from Wikidata. WDQS provides the means to query Wikidata, to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to answer, and to provide the base infrastructure on which our community can build tools and bots to query and edit Wikidata. We’ve written a [great blog post](https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/03/24/computational-knowledge-wikidata-wikidata-query-service-and-women-who-are-mayors/) if you want more context.

Wikidata has recently [reached item number 10’000’000](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2020/10/06/wikidata-reaches-q100000000/). Our graph database contains almost 12 billion triples, and has grown by over 250 [million triples over the last three months](https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000489/wikidata-query-service?viewPanel=7&orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-3M&to=now). This is one of the largest public SPARQL endpoints on the internet. You would be helping us support this rapid growth.

[CirrusSearch](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CirrusSearch) is the Mediawiki extension, backed by [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), that provides Search capabilities to all of our wikis, serving around [2000 requests per second](https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000455/elasticsearch-percentiles?viewPanel=47&orgId=1&var-cirrus_group=eqiad&var-cluster=elasticsearch&var-exported_cluster=production-search&var-smoothing=1). We do Machine Learning Ranking and other data centric approaches to Search, supported by [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).

Your job as part of this team would be to use your skills to help us maintain and scale the Wikidata Query Service and Search. Your first project is likely to be setting up an Apache Flink cluster on Kubernetes that will allow us to update Wikidata Query Service more efficiently. This platform has the potential to become our new standard for stateful stream processing across the Foundation.

Here are some examples of projects we have been (or still are) working on:

*   Rearchitecting and rewriting the update process that ships data from Wikidata to WDQS, introducing [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) as a stateful event processing framework.
*   Integrating [Wikidata and Search](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:WikibaseCirrusSearch).
*   Maintaining the beta [Wikimedia Commons Query Service](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata/2020-July/014154.html) (WCQS) SPARQL endpoint and upgrading it to production status.
*   Rearchitecting our Elasticsearch cluster to allow for additional growth in the size of our indices, splitting into more independent Elasticsearch clusters.

## You are responsible for:

*   Deployment, scaling, monitoring, provisioning and support of our Search and SPARQL endpoints
*   Providing guidance and expertise to the team on productionizing our applications

## Skills and Experience:

*   Experience as a Site Reliability Engineer, experience working on bare metal is a plus.
*   Experience with Configuration Management Systems (Puppet, Ansible, …)
*   Experience in supporting highly available and high-traffic web-facing applications.
*   Be open to supporting JVM-based applications.
*   English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team.
*   B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, related field, or equivalent in related work experience. Do not feel you need a degree to apply; we value hands-on experience most of all.

## Qualities that are important to us:  

*   Be passionate about [free culture / open source](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Guiding_Principles#Freedom_and_open_source)

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Experience with search
*   Experience with graph databases, in particular RDF / SPARQL
*   Experience with event streaming platforms (Kafka or similar)
