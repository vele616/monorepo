## Description

## At Vizibl, we’re on a mission to help every company work better, together. We want to help all companies make a difference in the world by revolutionising the way they work together, empowering them to reach their full potential.

We’re off to a great start too. Teams in some of the world’s largest enterprise companies are already collaborating with their suppliers through Vizibl and transforming the way they work to drive innovation together.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where every company sees the benefit of working openly and collaboratively. If you have the passion, curiosity and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s help every company work better, together.

Vizibl is a growing SaaS platform used by the world’s largest organisations to help change the way they work. Our unique blend of Enterprise know-how coupled with our beautiful and usable products is one of the things our customers love about us.

Vizibl is looking for a talented Back End Engineer that’s passionate about building scalable, maintainable, performant backend services that put security first without compromising on our commitment to openness. As Vizibl grows, so do our ambitions for the future of our backend services, which is why this is a great opportunity for the right person to join a talented team to drive exciting new projects that will help change the way the world’s largest companies work with each other.

This person will work across our backend services to help maintain our REST api, develop solutions to new problems, be involved in the design and architecture of the platform and work collaboratively to support the growth of the platform. The ideal candidate is a self-motivated person that cares deeply about building excellent products. They don’t settle for OK and have a desire to integrate themselves deeply into the working of the business.

As this is a fully remote position we'll be looking for strong communication skills and the ability to motivate yourself and your team to work independently.

If you’re interested in building products that challenge the status quo in the enterprise space and you enjoy an abundance of autonomy with just the right amount of alignment then we’d love to hear from you.
