## Description

At Fonoa, we automate taxes for the internet economy. If you want to launch a business today, there are plenty of products out there to help you get going - from Stripe for payments to Twilio for customer engagement.

How come figuring out taxes is so hard? Why isn’t there an easy way to implement a solution to handle all your taxes on products and services sold worldwide?

Enter Fonoa.

Our product suite enables determining indirect tax rates on any sales transaction, creating localized compliant receipts & invoices, and reporting them to tax authorities.

Our mission is to automate repetitive and fragmented manual tasks conducted by finance teams and developers via an easy to use API.

We are expanding our global presence and looking for many new team members to join us!

## About the role

As a UX/UI designer at Fonoa, your task will be to understand our target customers, internalize our business goals, analyze competitive product offerings, devise and deliver best in class design and work on implementing it (with our front end team).

Everything you touch will be consumed by our customers and partners, and you will have a direct and immediate impact on everything we ship.

In your role you will own projects from conception to launch and measure success through data and user research. You'll play a key role in roadmapping, feature design, and the quality of our products, and your work will impact both user and business goals.

We are solving one of the largest yet unsolved problems in global e-commerce and looking for a designer with a hunger for a new challenge and drive to solve a ubiquitous problem for companies selling globally. Our clients range from world-leading marketplaces, e-commerce, delivery to household-name mobility companies.

## Responsibilities

*   Work with product managers, engineers and lead product designer to define both the long-term strategy and short-term tactics for our product suite
*   Help defining the full product cycle from user goals, models, user journeys, user flows to high fidelity interfaces and translate them into wireframes and interactive prototypes
*   Design unified experiences across application platforms, including information architecture and interaction design
*   Proficiency with using prototyping tools such as Figma
*   Collaborate with software developers to transform product visions into intuitive, high quality experiences
*   Focus on key skills, whether that’s research, UX, wireframes, prototypes, designs — and you’ll have the opportunity to sharpen the skills you’re looking to develop
*   Work in a highly collaborative fashion with the design, product, and project teams
*   Consider all parts of the experience, from copy to animations to business model, when designing.

## Requirements

You are the right fit if you have

*   4+ years of digital product design experience working on web and native applications
*   Experience with B2B software best practices
*   Strong portfolio a must (candidates without demonstrated software design experience will not be considered)
*   Experienced in user research and usability testing but also have the ability to move quickly based on known requirements
*   Able to reduce complex problems down to the right balance of flexibility, power, and ease of use
*   Skilled in storytelling (explaining your work, process, and decisions)
*   Comfortable designing based on limited business requirements and open to iterative feedback to help our company produce its best work
*   Think in systems and are able to extrapolate and extend shared patterns and behaviors
*   Posses a collaborative work style, growth mindset, and get-it-done attitude

Desired, but not required

*   Experience working in fintech design
*   Experience working on brand identities
*   Experience writing UX copy
*   Familiarity with web design best practices

## Benefits

*   A very competitive compensation package including equity
*   Ability to work from any place in the world
*   A budget to purchase any equipment you need to do your job properly or access to a co-working space
*   An annual, expenses paid global meetup of the Fonoa team somewhere fun in the world (post-Covid)
*   A place on a rocketship backed by best-in-class VCs and operators innovating in an overlooked and unsexy area and doing it profitably and sustainably
*   A community and culture of builders and problem solvers

## Fonoa Culture

*   Flexible hours, set your own schedule that fits you
*   Best ideas win, no matter who expresses them
*   Builder’s first mindset. We give everyone a lot of autonomy to think of and deliver on their ideas
*   We move fast and enable small teams to ideate, prototype, test, and iterate quickly
*   Flat structure, excited team members, great incentives, no corporate BS
*   We value writing, mental clarity, and neat digital organization skills
*   We nurture asynchronous communication enabling everyone in the team to organize their work however they see fit

## Location
