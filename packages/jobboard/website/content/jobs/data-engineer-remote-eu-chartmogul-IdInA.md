    *   Extracting unique insight, benchmarks, or other such facts to power a content and PR machine
    *   Helping us understand our own business (pricing optimization, marketing attribution, churn, etc.)
    *   Helping our customers better understand their own businesses (product features that are beyond just 'metrics', e.g. benchmark features, machine learning to give recommendations or forecasts, etc.)
*   Working closely with our Security and DevOps teams, making sure we follow the most rigorous security practices
*   Collaborating with our product, sales, marketing, and engineering teams to understand and deliver the right requirements

*   Practical knowledge of CI/CD systems
*   Good knowledge of provisioning and orchestration tools
*   Familiar with different data tools, e.g., Stitch, Segment, Fivetran, Tableau, Looker, BigQuery, PowerBI, etc

## Behaviourally

*   You’re always up for pairing up and tackling problems with your colleagues
*   You're eager to learn, contribute to design and architecture decisions, and inspire change
