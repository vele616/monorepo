## Job description

**About you**

You have experience and are currently creating insight reports daily for your clients. You live and breathe insights, you love data, finding trends and making them aesthetically beautiful.

A part of this role is to show our value add to customers and what you would do here plays a big part in our success. We have a bunch of really exciting products that are driven by data and our insights team play a huge part in our sales process, showing our value proposition to potential clients to encourage them to use us.

You enjoy working with a small team and maybe also with a smaller company that is scaling. You are comfortable and enjoy the variety of working on a number of projects at once and you are adept at developing and maintaining analytical tools and models.

You love what you do and are passionate about your work. Do you maybe feel undervalued currently? Do you want to be part of a small but close team that is making a big impact on an exciting, growing company? If this is you, read on and apply today.

**About the role**

Cazana has been gathering a huge database of vehicle selling prices, images, mileages and hundreds of other data fields over the past six years. Analytics is a key part of our product offering – we extract numerous insights from the data we collect to help businesses and customers make better decisions about used vehicles. It's an exciting time to join the business, we're still a small team but we're growing and at pace.

You will have plenty to get your teeth into here at Cazana, from creating insights for our dealer clients, running retrospective reports for our insurance clients and other ad-hoc projects including product support to scope out new stuff, trend patterns and more. We also do some bespoke work for our clients.

You will work with our internal teams crossing the business, including sales and marketing.

**What you will be doing:**

*   Using python to extract insights from our data to help clients make important decisions
*   Build monthly reports for both internal and external use
*   Present your findings to technical and non-technical people
*   Gathering whole-market insights from our data for B2B and B2C marketing press releases
*   Create dashboards to display your findings

**About us**

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Founded in 2013, we are disrupting an industry that has typically been associated with mistrust due to the lack of accurate data. We use innovative AI and data-science driven modelling in a sector that can feel dated and we have developed the industry’s first real-time retail-driven valuations. Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:

*   Fairer to insurers: Avoid fraud. Price every policy correctly
*   Fairer to policyholders: Pay the right premium. Have claims settled fairly and fast.
*   Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models
*   Fairer to lenders: Lend based on fact, not anecdotes to reduce risk.
*   Fairer to dealers: Stock the right vehicles. Achieve a fair price for them all.

**What do you get (remuneration & benefits)?**

*   Salary: £26,500 - £35,000 DOE
*   All the equipment you need to get the job done
*   The ability to work where and when you want in order to get the job done (remote and flexible working welcome)
*   A central London office and meeting space to use when you need it
*   Access to free counselling, therapy and mental health support via [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/)
*   Access to free personal/ professional coaching via a trained internal coach
*   Cycle to work scheme
*   25 days holiday, all bank holidays off and any period of closure over Christmas also paid.
*   Learning and training supported
*   Ability to make your mark on a fast-growing start-up that is disrupting a huge (£34Bn annual) industry.
