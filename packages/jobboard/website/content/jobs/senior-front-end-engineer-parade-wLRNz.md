**Parade is a self-expression brand.** We make Creative Basics—underwear that celebrates who you are today. We believe that women’s underwear is a replenishment category that needs a mass-market challenger brand focused on delivering style and fabric innovation. Our DNA is community-first and catalyzed via mobile experiences because we know it’s the best way to find her. Parade has been honored by the Webby Awards and featured in [InStyle](https://www.instyle.com/fashion/parade-underwear-review), [Nylon](https://www.nylon.com/parade-underwear-brand-founder), [Teen Vogue.](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/parade-underwear-thongs-review) [Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9351825/parade-game-time-size-inclusive-underwear-collection), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/virgietovar/2019/11/19/new-underwear-brand-parade-offers-extended-sizing--sustainable-fabrics-for-9/#2a9abdb7192c) and other publications. Parade has raised more than $6M to date from top investors such as Greycroft and Lerer Hippeau, and the founders of Warby Parker, Casper, Bonobos, and Away. In our first full year, we're on track to do $10M in revenue and sell over 750K pairs of underwear!

Parade is growing! We are hiring a senior front-end engineer to join our Digital team as we continue to rewrite the American underwear story.

As a senior front-end engineer, you’ll build innovative e-commerce digital products to provide our community with a seamless and fun shopping experience. You’ll do much more than just write code - you’ll be an integral part of the entire digital product development process, from ideation through delivery and iteration. You will also be responsible for providing engineering leadership for the front end team, such as guidance on best practices and technology recommendations.

You’ll work on our Digital team, made up of folks across growth, design, and engineering, to drive our business forward and bring Parade to hundreds of thousands of people across the United States over the next year. This role reports to the Head of Engineering and will work closely with both them and our other front end engineer.

**Our Stack & Process:**

New front-end projects typically start with a set of Figma designs, coupled with detailed interaction notes, which we’d hand off to you. You’ll take these and turn them into live code on a weekly cadence. We value good software and believe in nimbleness as a defining characteristic of our success.

Our storefront runs on Shopify Plus, so you should be comfortable with Liquid templating and generally know your way around Shopify theme development and deployment. Strong HTML, CSS, and JS skills are a must-have. You should also be comfortable doing performance optimization on the front-end (and it’s a bonus if you’ve also previously optimized Liquid code.) It’s also important to have experience collaborating on complex, multi-developer projects.

It’s also a plus if you’ve ever worked with (or are comfortable building) Ruby on Rails apps -- we have a custom backend that powers a bunch of missing Shopify features, as well as supports our Product and Community teams’ internal processes; you’d periodically be helping ship features there, too. We typically operate on a one- to three-week sprint cycle, but are not overly dogmatic and prioritize opportunities to impact the business day-to-day.

**Role & Responsibilities:**

This is a fully-remote, full-time position. We’re mostly in LA and NYC, so at minimum you should be able to be available for a chunk of time during Eastern Time working hours. Most of us generally work for a block covering ~10am-6pm ET. Ideally you’re someone who has previously worked remotely, are comfortable communicating over Slack and email, and can self-manage your time and priorities. 

**Required Experience:**

\- You have 4-6+ years of web development experience in E-Commerce, including Shopify (Plus) experience

\- Strong JavaScript development skills and understanding of new ES6 concepts

\- Expert knowledge of CSS/SCSS and implementing web animations

\- Experience with integrating front-end frameworks like React/Vue with Shopify

\- Knowledge of build tools like Webpack and Babel for web performance and optimization.

\- Strong design instincts and enjoys working collaboratively with a team of designers

\- A commitment to creating readable, clean, and well documented code

**Very Nice to Have:**

\- A website or a portfolio

\- Experience with Ruby on Rails

\- Experience with headless architecture

\- Experience managing projects end to end in a PM-esque role

_Please note that we are unable to sponsor work visas at this time._
