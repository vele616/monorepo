If you are an excellent listener, assertive, persistent, and persuasive, then we’d love to meet you.This is a position for someone who has a passion for learning, loves fast-paced work environments, thinks outside of the box instead of waiting for solutions to be handed to them, and continuously exceeds expectations.
