The Wikimedia Foundation’s Online Fundraising team is looking for an experienced developer to join our team as Senior Frontend Developer, Online Fundraising, reporting to the Sr. Manager, Growth and Innovation. As the Senior Frontend Developer, Online Fundraising, you will work closely with our creative leads to implement innovations in our front-end flow that enable us to reach our $100M+ revenue goals and increase progress for our key performance indicators. You will work with our Lead Developer to maintain our front-end codebase, identify areas of improvement in the donor experience, and implement technical solutions that enable donor acquisition, retention, and engagement. 

_Please note: If your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you’d be great in this role, we’d love to learn more about you._

## You will be responsible for:

*   Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create and modify donation pages and banners.
*   Developing, testing, and deploying improvements and upgrades to the user interface and experience across various content channels managed by the Online Fundraising team. 
*   Supporting our Lead Developer in maintaining our front-end code base by implementing version control improvements, refactoring our code base as necessary, and creating documentation. 
*   Supporting our Sr. Manager, Lead Developer, and Designers in identifying our highest value optimization priorities and implementing a roadmap to achieve them.
*   Liaising with stakeholders in other departments, including fundraising engineers, product managers, etc. to ensure we’re providing an optimized front-end fundraising experience.

## Skills and Experience:

*   You will be mostly working with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. There may be an occasional need to work with PHP.
*   Experience with MediaWiki markup is a big plus, but can be achieved on the job.
*   Experience working with cross-functional teams to ship products and/or project management with multi-stakeholder needs.
*   Bachelor’s degree in CS or related field or the equivalent in work related experience.

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   Strong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online.
*   The ability to work and communicate effectively within a large team distributed across multiple time zones and with varying degrees of technical proficiency.
*   Values alignment and appreciation for the Wikimedia movement’s vision of making humanity’s knowledge accessible to everyone on the planet.

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Experience as a contributor to Wikimedia projects as an editor, developer, or in other capacity.
*   Experience with bug tracking and product management tools like Asana or Phabricator.
*   Familiarity with A/B testing and contributing iterative enhancements to online products.
