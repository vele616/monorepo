You will work with our Lead Developer to maintain our front-end codebase, identify areas of improvement in the donor experience, and implement technical solutions that enable donor acquisition, retention, and engagement. 

_Please note: If your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you’d be great in this role, we’d love to learn more about you._

## You will be responsible for:

*   Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create and modify donation pages and banners.
*   Developing, testing, and deploying improvements and upgrades to the user interface and experience across various content channels managed by the Online Fundraising team. 
*   Supporting our Lead Developer in maintaining our front-end code base by implementing version control improvements, refactoring our code base as necessary, and creating documentation. 
*   Supporting our Sr. Manager, Lead Developer, and Designers in identifying our highest value optimization priorities and implementing a roadmap to achieve them.
*   Liaising with stakeholders in other departments, including fundraising engineers, product managers, etc. to ensure we’re providing an optimized front-end fundraising experience.

## Skills and Experience:

*   You will be mostly working with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. There may be an occasional need to work with PHP.
*   Experience with MediaWiki markup is a big plus, but can be achieved on the job.
*   Experience working with cross-functional teams to ship products and/or project management with multi-stakeholder needs.
*   Bachelor’s degree in CS or related field or the equivalent in work related experience.

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   Strong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online.
*   The ability to work and communicate effectively within a large team distributed across multiple time zones and with varying degrees of technical proficiency.
*   Values alignment and appreciation for the Wikimedia movement’s vision of making humanity’s knowledge accessible to everyone on the planet.

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Experience as a contributor to Wikimedia projects as an editor, developer, or in other capacity.
*   Experience with bug tracking and product management tools like Asana or Phabricator.
*   Familiarity with A/B testing and contributing iterative enhancements to online products.
