Hi, I'm Matthew, CTO at [Customer.io](http://Customer.io). I'm looking for a Front-End Engineer to join our growing Engineering team.

We’re looking for a product-focused Front-End Engineer to build fast, intuitive interfaces in Ember.js. In this role, you’ll have a direct impact on the product with a high degree of ownership and freedom. We understand that you might not have all the skills we've listed, and that's okay. If you have a combination of some of the items listed and you're interested in developing in the others, we want to hear from you!

Our small, remote-first team is fun-loving, passionate and highly effective. We offer a lot of opportunity to grow and refine your skills while having a significant impact. Other members of our front-end team have backgrounds in a wide variety of industries, from creative agencies to education, and we believe that embracing our unique perspectives and expertise is key to our success as a collaborative team.

We value diversity, and as a distributed company are committed to giving you the flexibility and freedom to work from anywhere in the world, on a schedule that fits your family and your life.

## What you'll do:

*   Be a model and mentor for writing well-architected, well-tested and easy to understand UIs in JavaScript (Ember.js) that help our customers easily send timely & relevant messages at scale,
*   Contribute to and maintain our growing design system,
*   Collaborate with the product, design, and backend engineering teams throughout the development of front-end features,
*   Learn, practice, and share with your coworkers through code review, pair programming, team collaboration, and training to help improve our collective knowledge and best practices together,
*   Work with our tech support teams to diagnose operational issues and help our customers to achieve their goals with our product.

## What we're looking for:

*   A collaborative mindset backed by excellent communication skills and a desire to help us make great decisions in an empathetic and respectful way,
*   Experience working with customers and applying a deep understanding of their needs to produce timely solutions to their real-world problems,
*   Experience with using front-end technologies like JavaScript and CSS to build complex web applications. Ember.js experience is nice to have, but most of our engineers have succeeded while picking it up on the job,
*   A solid understanding of how to create front-end web applications that are both accessible and performant,
*   Comfort working in UNIX environments and applying modern collaborative development practices,
*   Experience working within a distributed company is preferred.

*   Internet + cell phone reimbursement - Up to $200 USD per month for your internet and cell phone plans
*   Co-working space reimbursement - Up to $300 USD per month for those times you'd prefer to work in a co-working environment
*   Learning + development - Up to $2,000 USD reimbursement per year to use on conferences, books, classes, or workshops - anything that will help you develop your skills
*   1 month paid sabbatical after four years at Customer.io  - to treat yourself to a vacation, or spend however you choose
*   Company retreats twice a year - we typically get together IRL every spring and fall, but most recently had an amazing virtual retreat!
*   Flexible schedule, work anywhere you want! - as long as you have a reliable internet connection and some overlapping work time with your manager, you can work where and when you want

All final candidates will be asked to complete an employment and education verification authorization form (which allows us to verify your job history and education listed on your resume) as part of our pre-employment process.

Customer.io recognizes the stifling impact of systemic injustice on diverse communities. We commit to using our influence to increase inclusion and equity within the tech industry. We strive to build an inclusive team culture, implement bias-free hiring practices, and develop community partnerships to expand our global impact.
