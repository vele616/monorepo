*   Work with software developers to ensure the execution of features with meticulous attention to detail
*   Contribute to a design process that embraces innovation while holding design accountable to end-user validation, usability KPIs, and customer feedback

*   A strong interest in the latest trends in design and technology with a focus on the future of computing and experience platforms

*   Experience designing in a 3D production pipeline
*   Experience working in Maya, Cinema 4D, or other 3D software
