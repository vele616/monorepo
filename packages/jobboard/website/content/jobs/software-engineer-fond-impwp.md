*   Ability to empathize with end-users; build with scale and ease of adoption in mind
*   Experience building in an agile setting with code reviews and quality as a priority
*   Strong design skills for separation and modularity of code; aversion to overly complex, spaghetti code

Here is an overview of what you can expect during the hiring process:

**Stage 1: Phone Interview** — After you submit your initial application, we’ll review it and reach out to candidates who seem like a good fit to schedule a 45-minute initial phone interview. On this call, we’ll discuss your past experience and learn more about your professional goals. 

**Stage 2: Video Interviews and Code Challenge** — We’ll send you a code challenge to review and get a head start on ahead of the interview. The first video interview will be with two members of our engineering team during which you’ll work on and review the challenge together. Following that, you’ll have two additional video interviews with other engineers on the team.

**Stage 3: Meet Fond’s CEO and Product Team** — Your last round of interviews will include a video interview with Fond’s Product / Design team, as well as a final video interview with our CEO.
