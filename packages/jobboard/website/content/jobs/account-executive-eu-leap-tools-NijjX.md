## Account Executive

This is the right job for you if...

You are competitive. You are a self starter. You are curious and ask insightful questions. You listen more than you speak, yet you are relentless in finding ways to deliver value to customers.

You will make offers to SMB and enterprise customers that they cannot refuse -- due to your deep understanding of our product and how it creates value. You will learn from your customers and those around you to sell millions of dollars worth of our tech around the world.

We are well funded and growing exponentially. Last year, our revenue grew faster than Uber when they were our size. We are building the world's most advanced tools for retail and e-commerce. Our customers include local retailers such as Alexanian's, Fortune 500 companies, and leading global brands such as Crate&Barrel. We are looking for obsessive and collaborative challenge-seekers to amplify our momentum and help us create an iconic Canadian tech company.

## What You'll Do:

*   Manage a full sales cycle from prospecting to close
*   Work with clients from SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise accounts across the world
*   Handle inbound and outbound lead flow
*   Take on additional projects to move the company forward
*   Grow will our organization and move into new roles as our team expands
*   Go above and beyond for your clients

## Requirements:

*   You are consistently a top quartile performer in anything you do.
*   You studied at least 2 influential sales and marketing books.
*   You can close at least 4 SMB-enterprise clients each month.
*   You have sold something for more than $50,000 before
*   You can mentor at least one team mate to improve the overall performance of our team.
*   You placed top 3 in competitions in the past.
*   You have the guts to apply, even if you don't fully meet all the requirements.

## About our culture

*   We work in tight-knit teams to maximize speed and cultivate an ownership mentality.
*   We cherish curiosity and an obsession for details because we know these details are invaluable over the long run.
*   We promote an environment where ideas are challenged. The best ideas win!
*   We're hyperfocused on our achievements and our ability to execute on our promises. We act with urgency.
*   It's not always about us. We give back to our community to ensure it can grow.
*   We love to compete and have fun. Our game nights are legendary.

About our products

Our technology lets you see products in your own room before you buy. Imagine you want to redesign your home and have been searching for new tiles for your kitchen, or a new rug for your living room. You definitely want to make sure it will look good in your space. We enable that through cutting-edge computer vision technology, presented in an extraordinarily simple and accessible way. Try our rug demo now! Simply upload a picture of your room using your mobile phone, and slide the rug under your coffee table: [https://www.roomvo.co/rugdemo4r](https://www.roomvo.com/rugdemo4r)Results

Our customers see a 5x increase in e-commerce conversion rates and a dramatic decrease in the time it takes for their customers to make a purchase decision. We are also reducing the world’s carbon footprint by eliminating trips to the store and avoiding product returns, while also saving marriages -- now you can be sure you’re buying the right product for your home.

## About our office and remote work

We are conveniently located in downtown Toronto with nearby access to both of the main subway lines. Our office is spacious with roomy desks, comfortable chairs, and top tech gear. The kitchen is packed with essentials including healthy snacks, exotic teas and fresh ground coffee. And we are surrounded by great restaurants and food options. The only downside is we don't have any plants (yet).

Many of us choose to work from home, either full-time or partially. We encourage our teams to work from wherever they are most productive. We’ve come up with a few ways to keep everyone on the same page, including a quick company-wide check-in every Monday, remote coffee breaks on Fridays, and ad-hoc topical sharing sessions. Another big upside is you get to be around plants (if you have them).
