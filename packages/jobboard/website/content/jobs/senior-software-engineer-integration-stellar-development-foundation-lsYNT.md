Interested in helping us change the world of payments forever? The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is looking for a talented, experienced, and hands-on engineer to assist partners with integrating into the Stellar network. In this role you’ll be designing, building, and implementing innovative blockchain solutions for our partners. You will lead the way in developing projects, from scoping & system design to development & best practice deployments. SDF’s partners span globally and are some of the most innovative software and financial companies.

## What you'll do:

## Who you are:

*   5+ years real-world experience developing or implementing software within enterprise networks
*   Solid understanding of web technologies: TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS, JSON, REST, etc
*   Proficiency with programming languages such as JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, or similar
*   Ability to lead technical discussions and explain technical details to non-technical people
*   Independent and results driven. Skilled at working in an environment with dynamic objectives (maybe you even thrive on chaos)

*   You’re passionate about top quality code and using the latest best practices
*   You build software with your users and their needs top of mind
*   You're a true partner advocate.
