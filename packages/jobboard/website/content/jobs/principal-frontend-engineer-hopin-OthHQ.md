## At Hopin, we’re reimagining virtual events.

As the first all-in-one virtual venue for live online events, Hopin brings people together in a highly interactive and engaging online experience that feels just like an in-person event, only without the barriers. Whether it’s a 50-person meetup, or a 50,000-person conference—any type of event organizer can host a Hopin event for their attendees, speakers, sponsors, and vendors to convene, learn, and interact face-to-face online. We’re spearheading the innovative technology that is enabling people to gather online like never before.

Our mission is simple: **better connections for a better planet**. 

We believe in events without limits, but events that are sustainable and accessible to everyone—and fun, too! To do this, we need passionate builders and storytellers to join us. Do you love people and technology and the magic that happens when they converge at scale? Do you have the skills and experience we’re looking for to better serve our clients? If so, we’d like to meet.

We’ve been recently funded by a16z, General Catalyst, IVP, Accel, DFJ Growth, Northzone, Coatue, Tiger Global, Salesforce Ventures and many other high profile investors.

## The Role

We are looking for self-motivated engineers with a passion for our business and for technology innovation. We look for individuals with deep knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML who are comfortable writing custom JavaScript but also know when to apply off-the-shelf solutions for the problem. We also value people who are advocates for user experience and seek to get the little details right. We currently work with TypeScript, React, and Next.js, but the ability to adapt to changing technology is an important strength. You believe in leaving things better than you found it - whether that be a piece of code, a jira ticket, or the new team you’re joining. We have a #NoEgo philosophy, so we love to collaborate and learn from each other together to come up with the best solution.

Our team includes people of all genders, sexual orientation, parents, the self-taught, the university-educated, and people of a wide variety of nationalities, ages, and socio-economic backgrounds. Diverse teams are strong teams, and we encourage those with varied identities, backgrounds, and experiences to apply.
