We're looking for a Senior Django dev to come and help us build the next iteration of [https://www.reskinned.clothing](https://www.reskinned.clothing/)  
  
We've recently completed the first part of the project, a 'Take-back' system for clothing brands to receive pre-loved garments in exchange for discounts and gift vouchers. Reskinned have launched with 2 brands initially but more are hopefully coming soon.  
  
[https://takeback.reskinned.clothing/finisterre](https://takeback.reskinned.clothing/finisterre)  
  
[https://takeback.reskinned.clothing/sweaty-betty](https://takeback.reskinned.clothing/sweaty-betty)  
  
The next part of the project is a staff admin tool to manage the processing and listing of the returned clothing items. This will involve some interesting integrations, eg. [https://www.ortery.com/](https://www.ortery.com/) plus bar-code scanners and various e-commerce APIs.  
  
The current app is built using Django, Strawberry GraphQL, React, Styled System. This next phase might not necessitate such a JS-based solution, but part of the process will be to help scope out the exact requirements and design an appropriate output.  
  
Contract length is 2-3 months, day rate is Â£500-600 DOE
