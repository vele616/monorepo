## Description

**About Birdie**

Birdie is a **pioneer in social innovation**. Our vision is to build a society in which we all age with confidence. With a rapidly growing ageing population, overcrowded care homes and social care services under water, we‚Äôre facing a social crisis. We‚Äôre on a mission to **reinvent care so that older generations can live longer, healthier and happier in their own homes**, surrounded by their families and their communities. We use digital products, cutting-edge home connected devices and AI to empower the care community to deliver better, preventative care

Launched in 2017, Birdie is a team of 65 socially motivated care, health, product and tech entrepreneurs.

We are building the organisation of the future that will not only improve the lives of millions of older adults but also of our team members, our communities and will protect the environment.
