VertiStudio is a distributed [team](https://themeisle.com/about-us/) of more than 20 people all over the world ( Romania, Poland, Greece, Portugal & more), together we run a [profitable](https://www.romanian-companies.eu/vertigo-studio-srl-29109287/) and bootstrapped business for more than 9 years. 

We’re not serial entrepreneurs and we don’t think we are the biggest, brightest developers tackling the biggest technical challenges on the planet. 

But we think companies have unique DNA; VertiStudio is our means to express ourselves in our professional lives. 

What makes us different?

It’s not a product, a methodology, or a one-page manifesto.

It’s through hundreds of little things that we’re different. 

## What will you be working on?

It depends on your interests & experience. 

We have 3 major projects: [Neve](https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/), [Optimole](https://optimole.com/) & [our own sites](https://vertistudio.com/#vertistudio-portfolio),  our products are being used by around 1 million people & our content sites reach half a million people every month. You will be the technical lead for one of these major projects. 

How will you get there?

We’d start with a short 2-week trial when you’ll identify some things that can be improved and start improving them immediately.

See, we’re looking for someone who can teach us something & take our team on the next technical level.

## What kind of people thrive here?

When I’m thinking about technical people, the ones that thrive are those that don’t like doing the same thing twice. 

They’re independent. They like to get to the bottom of the problem. They use the latest technologies, but they’re realistic enough to figure out how it fits the project.

Take this example: https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve/issues/1989 

Or the time an intern used a small internal hackathon as an opportunity to learn a new programming language by asking “can the blocks be made in exotic programming languages like PureScript, F# with Fable or Elm?”

For this particular role, you’ll need to understand WordPress really really well, have experience in leading a small team or at least running a major project on your own & have span PHP & Javascript knowledge.

## How to apply?

Use the form below and clearly state in a written or video form : 

*   Your experience with WordPress development.
    
*   What is your favorite code performance tweak & show us some code you’ve written that you’re proud of if possible
    
*   Tell us a bit about yourself and why you should be considered.
    
*   Profile links with code samples (GitHub, GitLab, WordPress.org, etc).
    
*   Other profile links if available (Your website, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc).
    
*   A technical improvement that you’ll do on https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve
    
*   For the input field asking if you agree, the answer is themeisle. Unfortunately 90% of the people doesn't seem to read this.

Please take your time to go through those and answer carefully, we don’t have a long interview process, nor any technical tests per se, we’ll need those answers and references to go through them and figure out your technical skills.

Note: I won’t be able to individually respond to all applications, if you’re a match we’ll reach out.

What does the process look like?

If you seem to be the right person, I will reach out to you for a quick 30’ meeting.  I would like to learn more about what you are looking for and answer your questions, alternatively, we can do this via text as well. 

If we agree to move forward, then the next step would be a chat with [Marius](https://github.com/selul), our CTO, about the technical work you’ve done and what you would like to do.

If this goes well, we’d move into the 2-week paid trial to see how things would work.

If this goes well, you’re hired.
