You’ll be responsible for carrying out manual quality assurance testing before launches and releases, ensuring that we are delivering work that meets defined functional and design specifications. The ideal candidate will apply critical thinking, user empathy, and an attention to detail such that they will be able to call out potential issues if something seems visually or functionally incorrect, even if those requirements are not documented in the functional spec or design comps. You’ll work with delivery teams to create comprehensive QA plans and test websites according to those plans as needed.

*   Ability to recognize and document problems with design and user experience.
*   Rigorous attention to detail.

## Nice to have

*   Familiarity with automated quality assurance testing approaches, including functional, unit, and integration testing, and experience in determining the appropriate testing approach(es) for unique challenges.
