## About Curebase

Curebase is the leading software platform for designing and executing "decentralized" clinical trials. We let any patient, anywhere in the world, contribute to critical medical research.

COVID-19 tailwinds have created massive demand for telemedicine and home-based trials, with 2 new FDA guidance letters and a major, positive industry mindset shift that will only accelerate this year.
