## Benefits

Disillusioned with the grind of daily commutes and mindless work, our co-founder Dave Nevogt started his own business with a remote team. Yet managing this global team quickly became a challenge. He knew there had to be a better way to track hours, pay contractors, send invoices, and manage projects — and that’s how [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/) started.

Today, our team runs on the [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/) platform, so we know what it takes to collaborate effectively with colleagues on the other side of the globe. It’s how we’ve continued to grow since 2012, and how we’ve helped customers do the same.

Now [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/) is a remote-first team that consists of over 80 wonderful people representing over 18 countries. We are not afraid of sharing our KPIs: right now Hubstaff’s revenue is growing about [2% monthly](https://hubstaff.baremetrics.com/).

We know the benefits of working from home and flexibly arranging work around our lives. Hubstaff is proud of its mission: help other people experience the same freedom and still effectively organize their work and reach business goals.

We also like to have fun while we work and our annual retreats are a big highlight of our year (when travelling is allowed...). Here's a [video](https://hubstaff.wistia.com/medias/9pyt01aemt) from our last retreat: [https://hubstaff.wistia.com/medias/9pyt01aemt](https://hubstaff.wistia.com/medias/9pyt01aemt)
