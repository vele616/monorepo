## At Hopin, we’re reimagining virtual events.

As the first all-in-one virtual venue for live online events, Hopin brings people together in a highly interactive and engaging online experience that feels just like an in-person event, only without the barriers. Whether it’s a 50-person meetup, or a 50,000-person conference—any type of event organizer can host a Hopin event for their attendees, speakers, sponsors, and vendors to convene, learn, and interact face-to-face online. We’re spearheading the innovative technology that is enabling people to gather online like never before.

Our mission is simple: **better connections for a better planet**. 

We believe in events without limits, but events that are sustainable and accessible to everyone—and fun, too! To do this, we need passionate builders and storytellers to join us. Do you love people and technology and the magic that happens when they converge at scale? Do you have the skills and experience we’re looking for to better serve our clients? If so, we’d like to meet.

We’ve been recently funded by a16z, General Catalyst, IVP, Accel, DFJ Growth, Northzone, Coatue, Tiger Global, Salesforce Ventures and many other high profile investors.

*   Provide shortlists of qualified candidates to hiring managers.
*   Send job offer emails and answer queries about compensation and benefits.
*   Monitor key recruitment metrics, including time-to-fill, time-to-hire and source of hire.
*   Collaborate with managers to identify future hiring needs
*   Act as a consultant to new hires and help them onboard

## Requirements

*   +3 years of experience in Talent Acquisition and HR related tasks in fast paced environments.
*   Experienced in hyper-growth environments, and SaaS.
*   Familiarity with Greenhouse ATS and resume databases.
