Interested in helping us change the world of payments forever? The Stellar Development Foundation is looking for someone to join our Ecosystem Team as an Ecosystem Evangelist. In this role, you will develop strategies and create content to educate and engage developers building on Stellar.  You will work with every single department inside SDF — as well as external partners and ecosystem participants — to help figure out and explain what it is we’re doing, and why. Your goal: to help realize the network’s potential.

## You have:

*   A strong writing portfolio, bootcamp experience, and/or 2+ years real-world experience in developer relations or technical writing
*   An understanding of web technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, JSON, and REST
*   A general knowledge of at least one programming language such as JavaScript, Go, C++, or Python
*   The ability to participate in technical discussions and explain technical details to non-technical people
*   A way with words

## You are:

*   Passionate about blockchain and emerging financial technology
*   An independent thinker, willing to float new ideas, and unafraid to ask obvious questions
*   Capable of hitting a deadline and, conversely, getting things done when there isn’t one
*   Logical, a strong problem solver, and a fast learner
*   Someone who finds time to write, no matter what

## Among other things, you will:

*   Collaborate with SDF developers on tutorials, blog posts, and presentations
*   Manage, announce, and explain Stellar-network releases
*   Actively participate in and moderate community forums 
*   Write and maintain developer and API docs 
*   Research and report on projects and trends in the broader blockchain space
*   Generate tons of content

## About you:

*   We’re looking for someone interested in blockchain and open-source technology who is curious, logical, organized, and a good writer
