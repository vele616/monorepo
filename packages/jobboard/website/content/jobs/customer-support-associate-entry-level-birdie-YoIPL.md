## Description

**About Birdie**

Birdie is a **pioneer in social innovation**. Our vision is to build a society in which we all age with confidence. With a rapidly growing ageing population, overcrowded care homes and social care services under water, we‚Äôre facing a social crisis. We‚Äôre on a mission to **reinvent care so that older generations can live longer, healthier and happier in their own homes**, surrounded by their families and their communities. We use digital products, cutting-edge home connected devices and AI to empower the care community to deliver better, preventative care
