## Description

**This is a remote role for anyone based in Europe**

Fonoa is building a next-generation API solution that enables automating a manual and laborious process for companies operating globally, with tax being at the heart of our product.

We’re already available in 60+ countries to enable businesses to meet their tax obligations and are looking to continue to expand. To render our growth, we’re looking for a Tax Technology Manager who will have the mission to bridge the gap between tax requirements and our existing product lines to help us continue to scale our offering.

You will be specifically working on the technical implementation of the indirect tax (VAT/GST) within our platform where you will conduct research, design and end-to-end delivery into our product lines. This is a varied role, as you’ll be one of our tax experts, implementing tax logic, test outputs, and establishing the level and type of data needed for compliance and country tax filings.

This role will be reporting to the Head of Product Innovation and Tax as well as working closely with our current Engineering, Product and Design teams.

We are solving one of the largest yet unsolved problems in global e-commerce and looking for people with hunger for a new challenge and drive to solve a ubiquitous problem for companies selling globally.

Our clients range from world-leading marketplaces, e-commerce, delivery to household-name mobility companies.

**The areas you will be working on:**

*   Work across teams and functions to design and build world-class indirect tax automation products ready for the digital future
*   Research tax requirements, draft blueprints and implementation briefs for the broader teams working on our product development
*   Develop a robust understanding of international tax standards and how they indirectly/directly impact our product
*   Investigate customer needs and product opportunities and translating these into tangible product recommendations
*   Work with external advisers and service providers to ensure our products and systems are meeting the highest tax technical and content standards
*   Monitor market developments, including relevant legislative changes on indirect tax, (real-time) reporting, marketplace liability developments, e-invoicing requirements etc. and translate these into actionable input for our broader product and engineering teams

## Requirements

*   Have at least 3 years of experience in indirect tax with relevant tax qualifications
*   Relevant tax education and broad knowledge of current international Indirect tax (VAT/GST) laws and regulations
*   Both public accounting / legal firm and industry experience
*   Experience within a fast-growing international organization
*   Are curious, like to understand how things work
*   Like to solve problems, turning complex problems into simple solutions
*   Are self-directed and capable to work autonomously
*   Experience with indirect taxes as it relates to the distribution of digital services and physical products
*   Passionate about technology and innovation
*   Ability to research and communicate technical tax issues clearly to non-tax team members and work effectively across all functional teams
*   Have full professional proficiency in English, written and spoken

**Nice to haves**

*   Fintech, marketplace and/or e-commerce experience is a big bonus

## Benefits

*   A very competitive compensation package including equity
*   Ability to work from any place in the world
*   A budget to purchase any equipment you need to do your job comfortably or access to a co-working space
*   An annual, expenses paid global meetup of the Fonoa team somewhere fun in the world (post-Covid)
*   A place on a rocketship backed by best-in-class VCs and operators innovating in an overlooked and unsexy area and doing it profitably and sustainably
*   A community and culture of builders and problem solver
