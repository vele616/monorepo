## Job description

We are hiring a Lead Software Engineer to support the growing Forem engineering team and ongoing development and maintenance of Forem. This is a hybrid engineering leadership and management role. In this role, not only will you be an individual contributor writing code, but you will also be managing a small number of engineers (1-3). This role is ideal for someone who can handle a lot of autonomy and has the ability to bring folks together around technical initiatives.

As a company we place a high value on emotional intelligence and communication skills which are essential for working in an async first workplace. We also want to work with developers who want to build an inclusive software ecosystem as badly as we do.

## Primary Responsibilities

*   Work across the entire stack (Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML) to deliver features and improve our codebase.
    
*   Actively lead and contribute to our project planning efforts helping guide the team based on your experience and knowledge.
    
*   Help the core Forem team improve our development process and instill best practices
    
*   Collaborate cross-functionally with team members, DEV community members, and open source contributors to achieve elegant solutions
    
*   Formally manage 1-3 engineers
    *   Conduct weekly or bi-weekly 1:1s so you have a strong pulse on your report’s performance, personal and professional goals, and general wellbeing
        
    *   Act as an advocate for your reports and challenge them to grow their skills (job skills, people skills, leadership skills)
        
*   Mentor and teach less experienced engineers
    

## Requirements

**Skills we’d like to see**

*   A deep understanding of Ruby and Rails and how they interact with external infrastructure (servers and databases)
    
*   Always considering performance, reliability, and scale when writing and reviewing code
    
*   The ability to architect a solution to a complex problem and complete it from end to end
    
*   At ease delivering on multiple competing priorities with little supervision
    
*   Proficient understanding of code versioning tools (Git)
    
*   Excellent verbal and written communication skills
    
*   Motivated, self-starter who enjoys working independently but can collaborate with other team members when needed
    
*   Experience managing other engineers
    
*   Ability to collaborate with company leadership to match company priorities to individual and team priorities
