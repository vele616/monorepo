As a Senior Technical Support Specialist within WPForms, you’ll be responsible for supervising a small group of support team members. You'll work with these team members closely to help guide their professional development, provide advice through your WordPress expertise, ensure individual and team goals are consistently met/exceeded, and continually reinforce a positive, team-oriented culture.

To love this role, here’s the type of person you are:

*   You find deep satisfaction in helping others to grow and succeed.
*   When unexpected things come up, or you're under time pressure, you're eager to rise to the occasion and help your team rise with you.  
    
*   You’re an excellent and consistent communicator who makes sure nothing slips through the cracks - even if that means having difficult conversations.
*   You’re a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through to completion.
*   You're a committed life-long learner, and know that you have at least as much to learn from your team as they do from you.
*   You take pride in the quality and craftsmanship of your work rather than just doing it to get it done.  
    

Responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*   Within your small group (4-6 team members), continually monitoring performance and providing individual feedback.
*   Ensuring team members in your group meet or exceed team goals.
*   Communicating regularly with other senior support/support leads so everyone is on the same page.
*   Assisting with support trainings, including onboarding of new support team members.
*   Pre-processing tickets to assess their technical difficulty and provide relevant tips before team members reply.
*   Helping the support team to manage fluctuating workloads. This can include tasks such as: taking over challenging or overdue tickets, working the support inbox, providing support on public forums such as WordPress.org.  
    
*   Testing bug reports locally, and when confirmed pass them to the development team with detailed instructions.
*   Pre-release quality assurance testing for updates and new releases.  
    
*   Communicating with the team and supporting your peers using chat, audio, and video.

Skills you'll need to succeed in this role:

*   At least 1 year of experience managing a team of 2 or more.
*   At least 2 years of experience with WordPress.
*   Excellent English writing and communication skills, including a strong ability to show empathy in your writing. We believe communication is **critical**.
*   Strong leadership with the ability to step up and take charge.
*   Patience, grace, and a sense of humor.
*   Talent for taking something complicated and explaining it simply.  
    
*   Ability to prioritize workloads in order to balance an assortment of tasks and meet deadlines.
*   Exceptional troubleshooting abilities (ie include finding CSS  and JavaScript conflicts using browser developer tools, determining whether a plugin could be causing a code conflict).  
    
*   Strong comprehension of HTML and CSS - you can write HTML and apply styling "from scratch".  
    

## Bonus points if you also have:

*   Proven track record working in / managing a support team for WordPress plugins.  
    
*   Experience managing a team remotely.
*   Experience using WPForms and/or WP Mail SMTP.
*   Experience working with the services WPForms integrates with (Zapier, Mailchimp, Drip, Stripe, etc).
*   Experience with WordPress development (eg themes, hooks, filters, plugin API, PHP,  etc).
