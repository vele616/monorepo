Over a million designers use Sketch to transform their ideas into incredible products every day. Want to join us and help us take our customer support to the next level? We’re looking to grow our talented team with a full-time **Licensing Specialist**.

**The job**

As a **Licensing Specialist at Sketch**, your focus will be on giving our customers the help they need, fast. From general questions related to their license, subscription, payments and account details to specific licensing-focused problems, troubleshooting and bugs. We’ll expect you to manage these enquiries, and respond in a friendly, respectful and helpful manner.

**The challenge**

2021 is going to be a super exciting year at Sketch. Our business and team are growing fast and we want to continue to give our customers a first-class service.

In the coming months we’ll launch major new features, while improving our internal processes and incorporating new tools and technology to give our customers the level of service they deserve.

As Customer Support, our main task is to keep our ticket backlog small and give customers useful answers, fast. That might mean solving customer inquiries on your own, working with the Product team, or opening a Github ticket to make sure our Technology team knows about a bug.

We are a remote company, which has plenty of advantages — but it can be a challenge to keep up with our rhythm. Don’t worry though — we’ll all help you, and you’ll feel like part of the team in no time.

**About you**

You are passionate about helping others, and you have previously worked at a Customer Care or Contact Center.

Your friends would probably describe you as a **friendly, tech-savvy person, who quickly learns** and adapts to new tech.

Above all you seel a good balance between **solving a problem fast, and providing a good solution**. You've always been a **multitasker with a strong focus in quality**.

You’re looking for a new adventure and want to feel that what you do is meaningful both for you and for others. You’re a team player who’s willing to work in a fast-paced environment with shifting procedures.

**About Sketch**

Sketch is a 100% remote company, and your colleagues are distributed around the globe. Being remote adds great flexibility, and helps us build a more diverse team. We put respect for each other above everything else.

Besides being remote, we work asynchronously as often as we can. This means that our team communicates mostly using Slack. When we need it, we also have video calls.

In **Customer Support,** there are 14 people split into two teams — Licensing and Technical Support. The Licensing team that you’ll be joining has seven members.
