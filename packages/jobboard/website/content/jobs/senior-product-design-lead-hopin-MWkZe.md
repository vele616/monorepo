Hopin is seeking a design leader who is self-driven, passionate, compassionate and ambitious. We're looking for someone with the ability to go from the "big picture" view of a user experience right down to the "close-up" level of pixels and micro-interactions.

We're excited to work with someone who is proactive, highly motivated, comfortable in a rapidly changing start-up environment, and happy to work with a remote-first team. We're currently a team of 400+, and you will be working with a growing team of senior product designers.

We’re looking for experience in:

*   Remote working
*   Fast-paced environments and product based companies (mobile or web)
*   Close collaboration with Engineering and Product Management.
*   Designing and shipping product experiences for international audiences. Any experience working on products in the event or live streaming space would be a plus

Experience comes in many forms and passion goes a long way. If your background is close to what we are looking for, please consider applying even if you can’t check every box

Communication

*   Fluent in English.
*   Confident communicating complex product challenges and UX / UI flows
*   Excellent communication skills and an ability to work closely with creative, technical, and business stakeholders

Preferred

*   Previous experience with a video platform
