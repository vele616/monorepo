## Description

[Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) helps researchers to find, organize, read, and write academic papers.

In addition to the Paperpile app, we have recently introduced a new product [BibGuru](https://bibguru.com/) for students. We are signing up thousands of new students every day.

Our user base is growing fast, and so is the team around it.

*   As part of a small team, **everything you do matters**. You only work on stuff that has a direct big impact on the product and our customers.
*   **Work from anywhere on your own schedule**. As a remote-first company, we communicate with tools like Slack, Figma, and Notion to move our product forward fast.
*   **Work with an interesting and diverse community of academics**. Our customers use Paperpile to study climate change, cancer, or medieval history. You interact with them directly to understand how we can make their work more productive.

We use Typescript/JavaScript across all our product lines: web-apps, browser extensions, Google Docs and Microsoft Word plugins, server-side scripts, iOS and Android apps (React Native) and desktop app (Electron).

You will take responsibility for substantial parts of our codebase and develop and ship new features and products.

**This job is fully remote but we only hire in EUROPE at this time.**

## Requirements

*   You can work independently and write **clean, reusable and testable code**.
*   You can work and communicate within a **Scrum** team and produce production-ready code efficiently and on time.
*   You have a deep understanding of core web technologies (**REST APIs, CSS3, HTML5, ...**)
*   You understand **TypeScript/JavaScript** inside-out and are up-to-date with modern developments of the language.
*   You have experience with **Node.js** and the ecosystem around it (Express, Babel, Webpack, Jest, Yarn,...)
*   You have experience with **React** and have worked on large React-based web apps before.

More useful experience (optional):

*   React Native
*   Electron
*   Browser extensions (Chrome/Chromium, Safari, Firefox, ...)
*   Native iOS and Android development
*   AWS, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Linux
*   Background in research or academia

## Benefits

*   Base compensation €40,000-€60,000 based on the level of your experience
