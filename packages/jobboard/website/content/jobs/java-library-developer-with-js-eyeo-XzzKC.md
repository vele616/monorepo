## Get to know us

We create open source software that puts users in control over their online browsing experience. Our desktop and mobile products, such as Adblock Plus, Adblock Browser and Flattr, help sustain and grow a fair, open web, because they give users control while providing user-friendly monetization. Our most popular product, Adblock Plus (ABP), is currently used on over 100 million devices.

## What you'll do

You will work on the WebView-based Android SDK and LibAdblockPlus together with a highly-skilled team of engineers in a remote-first setup. We use Gradle to build our SDK and a little bit of Python in automation. Git is our version control system of choice.

## A little bit about the team you’ll work with

The Distribution Partners team works on growing eyeo’s user numbers by finding and collaborating with partners that help us scale our user base. Our partners include leading players in the browser and OEM markets; we collaborate closely with them to integrate ad-blocking technologies into their projects. We do this by providing, maintaining and constantly updating the SDKs that make it easy for our partners to integrate with us. We add features and functionality based on partner feedback and new trends in the markets around us.

When applying, please share via link a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you’ve worked on.
