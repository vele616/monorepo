**About the role**

Kentik, the leading Network Analytics platform, is looking for an experienced SRE/DevOps engineer to architect, build, monitor, and operate the physical and virtual systems that power our products.

We’re looking for a self-starter who can quickly develop a clear plan and determine what’s necessary to implement and maintain it. We operate a well-organized, well-instrumented platform, with an emphasis on results rather than process. We’re expanding fast and offer enormous opportunities for employee growth.

## What you'll do

*   Be part of a 7-person team across 4 different countries and 4 different time zones, and will participate in a follow-the-sun on-call rotation, working during your preferred hours.
*   Provide valuable feedback on team goals, projects, and processes. We believe in continuously improving our team.
*   Manage a real-time, scalable, microservices-based infrastructure running on free software, in 6 physical locations and all 3 major clouds.
*   Write design documents to introduce new architectures or suggest changes to our existing infrastructure, accommodating for growth and solving scaling issues, while deep-diving in diverse topics, ranging from NetFlow and IP routing, to mysql replication strategies or HTTP optimization.
*   Take part in handling incidents and their RCA afterwards, providing valuable input at all stages.
*   Contribute code and tools or improve and extend all kinds of existing code. We believe in _infrastructure as code_ and _cattle not pets_ principles, so everything about our infrastructure is reflected in code.

## What we’re looking for

*   Minimum experience: 4 years of relevant SRE or Systems Administration.
*   Communication: Kentik is a remote-first company, so we're looking for a team player who is able to work and collaborate in an asynchronous environment via tools such as email, Google Docs, Slack, Zoom, and Git.
*   Linux experience: You’ve managed Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu installations in the past.
*   HTTP experience: You know what TLS, nginx, HAProxy, or HTTP headers are.
*   Networking experience: Terms such as routes and iptables sound familiar.
*   An urge to document code, processes, and infrastructure in runbooks and wikis.
*   A preference to automate your way out of tedious and repetitive tasks — toil is bad.
*   Some familiarity with coding in Python, Ruby, or Go, while using Git to record your changes.

## Desirable skills or experience

*   You've worked in a microservices environment in the past and feel comfortable working with complex architectures.
*   You know your way around Linux networking and have worked with policy routing or have some experience with dynamic routing. Example software: iptables, bird, FRR/Quagga, exaBGP.
*   You have developed configuration management code in the past, either to configure servers or networking hardware. Example software: Puppet, Ansible, Chef.
*   You’ve used, configured, or know how a CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins works.
*   You’re familiar with a metrics platform such as Grafana or Prometheus, understand why it's needed, and would always check it to validate your assumptions.
*   You’ve used or configured an ELK stack in the past.
*   You’ve got some experience with Cloud infrastructure, and used tools such as Terraform or Packer.

**The list is not exhaustive or in any way a checklist; we'll be happy to hear about any other skills or experience you may have!**

If you find the position interesting, we’d be happy to hear from you!

**Why work at Kentik?**

We offer a competitive salary, first-rate benefits and the chance to work at a fast-growing, well-funded startup that builds something special: the industry's most powerful observability platform for the network professional. You will have the opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers, network experts, and technology thought leaders to build the future of digital operations. Kentik is headquartered in San Francisco with team members around the world.
