**üèÜ What‚Äôs the opportunity?**

As a remote first company, [cargo.one](http://cargo.one) has the unique challenge of finding talent globally (literally) to join our mission to pioneer the digitisation of an entire industry. We are on the hunt for the best people in their field to join us. In the last year we have grown from 43 to over 120 people and launched in the Americas. In the year ahead we will continue to grow and expand to APAC too! 

Now at Series B, some globally prominent investors including [Index](https://www.indexventures.com/companies/), [Bessemer](https://www.bvp.com/companies) and [Point9](https://www.pointnine.com/p9-family) also stand behind the potential of [cargo.one](http://cargo.one) and how we are creating the future of how the air cargo industry will work!

In this role you will get to work on challenges that are not just the ordinary recruiting challenges. As a remote first company, we are constantly thinking about how we position ourselves to become a global talent magnet as one of the most attractive (remote) places to work in the world.

You will get to work on defining new teams, understanding how they will bring value to the company and putting in place a hiring strategy to support the growth of the teams and company. You will be a consultant and advisor to the Heads of and leaders within the organisation on topics like market trends and data and share your expertise in innovative sourcing. As a start up, there are also still many areas where we look to create efficiencies and become more sophisticated in our hiring. You will take ownership of and drive some of these topics.

Our People team is still small but we are an ambitious team who have joined to draw on our experience at Wise (previously Transferwise), King (Candy Crush), Buffer (one of the world‚Äôs first remote-first companies) and [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and we have made it our mission to become a best in class team who hires and nurtures the best talent worldwide. From day 1 you will have the opportunity to bring your expertise to the table, take ownership and start driving impact. ¬†

‚ö†Ô∏è Working in distributed teams, we are open to you being based in any country on [this](https://www.cargo.one/remote-working) growing list.

## üé¨A snapshot of what you will be doing here:

*   You will be coaching and advising our super talented Heads of and leaders who joined us from companies like GetYourGuide, Expedia, BCG, N26 and Amazon on how to make great hiring decisions for their teams and consulting on interview techniques as we grow globally.¬†
*   You will use your passion and expertise in sourcing to find and attract the best talent with innovative approaches and guide them through an exceptional candidate journey.
*   You will collaborate with our TA Lead to constantly look at how we are positioning ourselves as an employer to ensure we become a great talent magnet.
*   You will look at identifying ways of bringing in D&I into every touchpoint with candidates.
*   You get to work with Steph, our Remote Lead to create a remote-first hiring approach that will set industry standards for hiring remotely.

## üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We think you will love working here if:

*   You value building great relationships and trust with your team and managers
*   You love experimenting with new ideas, and get super excited when you have found a new way of sourcing that no one else has heard of!¬†
*   You want to be part of a team that wants to be best in class and renowned for being innovative and constantly at the forefront of new ways of working.
*   You see working remotely successfully as a pioneering challenge which is constantly evolving.
*   In everything you do, you take ownership and get a kick out of exceeding expectations
*   When faced with the choice, you‚Äôd rather opt for the ambitious to ensure you grow, than take the easy option.
*   You constantly look at better ways of working, iterating to get to that perfect approach.
*   You aim to hire the best people, even if it means your search will take that little bit longer.

## üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We are looking for individuals with:

*   Industry understanding of the key tech hubs and locations to find the best talent
*   Ideally experience in a high growth start-up, scale-up or tech company
*   An understanding and experience of finding the best tech talent across multiple locations
*   A data driven approach to sourcing and hiring
