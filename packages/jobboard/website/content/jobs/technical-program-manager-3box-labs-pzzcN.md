Do you want to build the foundations of a better web alongside a passionate, high-impact team? Do you want to help tackle some of the most novel challenges in decentralized tech, working with partners like Protocol Labs and a rapidly growing open source community?

[3Box Labs](http://3boxlabs.com) is advancing a more open web by liberating information from silos and rebuilding trusted relationships between users, apps, and data. We created the leading identity and data solution for Web3, and alongside our open source developer community we're approaching the launch of [Ceramic Network](http://ceramic.network). We have huge and novel challenges ahead. We need impact-driven, intentional, fast-learning teammates to join us in realizing the vision of a more trusting and connected web.

The Role

As the Technical Program Manager, you will coordinate the Ceramic core protocol team to deliver a world-class web3 protocol that will shape the future of the internet.

## You will get to..

*   Developed a deep and broad understanding of our protocol, implementation, and technology stack, and use it to ensure development efforts across the team are coherent and well-prioritized
*   Own an end-to-end release process that makes the day-to-day life of our engineers easy and enables clear communication to the community of improvements, priorities and expectations
*   Foster an environment where engineers are empowered to contribute in the most effective way for them, without having to worry about too much process
*   Make sure the team always has a sense of short, medium, and long-term priorities, including a solid roadmap and progress tracking
*   Drive consistent improvement in our team's efficiency even as we scale, driven by a deep commitment to our mission and constant desire to improve

## You're likely a great candidate if you have..

*   Engineering experience and a deep fundamental understanding of computer science
*   4+ years of experience working in a lead technical position, coordinating a large team
*   A love for building great teams and helping people work more effectively together
*   A results-driven mentality with the resourcefulness, grit and influence to make sure things get done
*   Great attention to detail and organizational skills, with as much appreciation for great execution as exciting ideas

The Team

We are a lean, voraciously curious team spread across Europe and the East Coast. We are impact driven, intentional about our role, communications and actions, and intensely focused on building quality tools for our open source community. We believe a better model for managing identity and data online can give power back to users and builders, that this model is key to a growing movement, and that our team is a critical part of making that movement successful.

We pay competitively and fairly across the globe, offer great and flexible benefits, and view everyone on our team as an owner -- both with generous equity grants and lots of agency to help set our direction.

We are committed to [building a diverse and inclusive team](https://www.notion.so/threebox/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711#fd55a523870040cb91b83e22dd73c49f). We cannot succeed in our mission without it. People that identify with groups traditionally underrepresented in tech are particularly encouraged to apply.Â
