Fond’s engineering team aspires to deliver industry-leading elegant, innovative solutions and to help formulate processes that work for us. We utilize microservices that are primarily in Ruby on Rails with a React frontend. We also build native iOS and Android apps.

Fond is headquartered in Portland, but we are currently operating as a fully remote team due to Covid. Our ideal candidate will be in the Pacific or Mountain time zone.

## Responsibilities

*   Work as part of a collaborative, agile team to deliver industry-leading engagement capabilities in web and mobile.

*   2+ years experience in production web application development
*   2+ years of experience working with Ruby on Rails or an equivalent web framework and language
*   Experience writing JavaScript code, either vanilla JS or using a framework such as [Node.js](http://Node.js) or React, Redux 
*   Unit and automated testing experience (e.g. RSpec, Selenium)
*   3rd party API usage and integration experience
*   RDBMS usage (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
*   Ability to empathize with end-users; build with scale and ease of adoption in mind
*   Experience building in an agile setting with code reviews and quality as a priority
*   Strong design skills for separation and modularity of code; aversion to overly complex, spaghetti code
*   Persistence: design it, build it, if it breaks, fix it, but make it work, and make it shine

## Bonus Skills

*   Free and/or Open Source project work
*   Amazon Web Services, DevOps experience
*   Database Design
*   Mobile app development experience a huge plus; native iOS or Android or React Native

## Fond Benefits

*   Competitive salary and equity package
*   Great culture and team camaraderie
*   100% employee + 60% dependent/spouse premium coverage on Health, Dental, and Vision insurance

Here is an overview of what you can expect during the hiring process:

**Stage 1: Phone Interview** — After you submit your initial application, we’ll review it and reach out to candidates who seem like a good fit to schedule a 45-minute initial phone interview. On this call, we’ll discuss your past experience and learn more about your professional goals. 

**Stage 2: Video Interviews and Code Challenge** — We’ll send you a code challenge to review and get a head start on ahead of the interview. The first video interview will be with two members of our engineering team during which you’ll work on and review the challenge together. Following that, you’ll have two additional video interviews with other engineers on the team.

**Stage 3: Meet Fond’s CEO and Product Team** — Your last round of interviews will include a video interview with Fond’s Product / Design team, as well as a final video interview with our CEO. You will have the chance to gain a deeper understanding of Fond’s product, core values, and company roadmap.

**Stage 4: Offer** — If we believe you’d be a good fit at Fond, we will make you an offer we hope you’ll accept!

Note that you don't need to possess 100% of the qualifications to be considered.

At Fond, we celebrate uniqueness. We don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. Women, BIPOC, LGBTQ, and other under-represented groups are highly encouraged to apply.
