## The Role

Hopin is seeking a digital product designer who is self-driven, passionate, compassionate and ambitious. We're looking for someone with the ability to go from the "big picture" view of a user experience right down to the "close-up" level of pixels and micro-interactions.

*   Iterate on feedback from the team and your users, improving the quality of the product experience
*   Create prototypes and collaborate with engineers and stakeholders to make sure the product meets the highest standards of quality
*   Run usability tests, own the product experience in your area, and advocate for quality
*   Work together with our in-house team of product designers, and other external design agencies to ensure coherence over the full user journey

*   Proficiency with current industry standard design and collaboration tools (Figma, Sketch, Protopie, Principle, Framer…)
*   You’re vocal about design values and process, and are willing to challenge the current establishment
*   You take pride in your work, but you are flexible about making changes and hearing others thoughts. Humility is really important at Hopin
*   You’re proactive about seeking feedback and explaining designs to engineers, product managers and other designers
*   You’re willing to build Hopin Design Culture with us

We’re looking for experience in:

*   Remote working
*   Fast-paced environments and product based companies (mobile or web)
*   Close collaboration with Engineering and Product Management.
*   Designing and shipping product experiences for international audiences. Any experience working on products in the event or live streaming space would be a plus
