## About the role

Kentik is seeking to expand its Insights staff. Part of our backend services, Insights is in charge of telling network owners and operators things they don't already know about their network. Examples include automated DDoS defense, interface labeling by traffic observation and cost optimization. 

Our platform ingests hundreds of billions of records and serves hundreds of thousands of queries for our users each day. You will gain experience building a production quality, high performance server-and-client SaaS application that handles uniquely high volumes of data.   

We have built a team of world-class engineers, network experts, and technology thought leaders in a remote-friendly culture from day one. While prior experience in a remote environment is not required, we highly value strong collaboration and communication skills, as well as a high level of independence and autonomy.

## What to expect in this role

*   Working, most likely in Go, on new features, performance improvements and bug fixes
*   Analyzing and modeling data, from time series like metrics to more structured things like network topology
*   Interacting closely with product managers to help shape upcoming features
*   Supporting customers as well as internal groups like sales and operations on questions and issues involving the services you work on

## What we're looking for

*   Prior experience designing, implementing and running data-intensive distributed systems
*   5+ year experience with C/C++, Go, Java, Python, Rust or similar
*   Good communication: Kentik is a remote-first company, so we're looking for a team player who is able to work and collaborate in an asynchronous environment via tools such as email, Google Docs, Slack, Zoom, and Git.
*   Bonus points for prior experience on any of the following: networking (IP, BGP, MPLS, Flowspec), API design using grpc/protobuf, kafka, and data visualization

## Benefits & Perks

*   Medical, Dental, and Vision that is 100% covered for employees & dependents
*   Health Reimbursement Account
*   Wellness Benefits
*   Maternity/Paternity leave
*   Stock Options
*   Flexible time off
*   Vanguard 401(k)

**Why work at Kentik?**

We offer a competitive salary, first-rate benefits and the chance to work at a fast-growing, well-funded startup that builds something special: the industry's most powerful observability platform for the network professional. You will have the opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers, network experts, and technology thought leaders to build the future of digital operations. Kentik is headquartered in San Francisco with team members around the world.
