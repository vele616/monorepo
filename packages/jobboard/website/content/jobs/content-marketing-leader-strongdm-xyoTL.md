**strongDM is a customer-first, second, and third company with a rabid fan base. When was the last time you heard things like:**

_\* Splunk's CISO Joel Fulton says "strongDM gives you what you can’t get any other way -- the ability to see what happens, replay and analyze incidents."_

_\* Chef's co-founder Adam Jacob says "strongDM takes the friction out of getting staff access to the systems they need."_

**Customers love us because:**

[The product rocks:](https://youtu.be/KvdsrELgAY0) strongDM fundamentally changes the relationship between InfoSec, DevOps, and end users. Enforce the controls security needs while making it easier to facilitate access.  

[They can trust us:](https://www.strongdm.com/blog) we built a technical product for technical buyers. We do not use jargon. There is no alternative but to always be technically accurate. We are not afraid to admit product gaps.  

[We’re real humans](https://www.strongdm.com/about): we built a serious product without taking ourselves too seriously. Each member of the team is deadly good at their job, and yet we crack jokes on the phone with customers.
