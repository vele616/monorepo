Sketch is a design platform with an award-winning native Mac app and browser-based collaboration tools. Over a million people use our product to create their best work. And right now, we’re looking for Mac developers to join us.

Our Mac app is a powerful vector editor at its core, but unlike many other design tools, we built it for UX/UI design. We pay attention to use cases like icon design and prototyping, and we pioneered features like Symbols and Libraries to create reusable design components.

You’ll join over 60 Mac, backend, frontend, QA and infrastructure engineers in the Technology team. We work in multi-disciplinary teams with different areas of responsibility. Some of us focus our technology foundations, others work on product verticals. Our work impacts the entire company, so you can expect to work closely with product managers and designers, as well.

**About you**

You'll be working on our Apple Design Award-winning Mac app. We primarily develop using **Swift**, though the Mac app has a large body of existing **Objective-C** which you'll need to be comfortable working with.

**In addition to coding, you'll review code** from other engineers to keep our quality high and help the whole team to constantly improve. Day to day you will work with an engineering manager, world-class designers and other Mac and web engineers to specify, design and build features for Sketch. You are expected to have a certain degree of autonomy and to **balance work on features alongside improvements and bug-fixing** while working on a **Continuous Delivery** environment.

Not everything that you or your team do can be perfect, but you make sure that you always understand the trade-offs. You back your decisions with **arguments**. You **don't care for hype** and always try to **find the best solution and technology for the job** and its context.

You are a pragmatist and understand that technology is a medium to **build products**. You understand the tradeoffs between code readability, simplicity, development speed, performance and maintainability.

**About Sketch**

We’re a company of diverse thinkers and doers who take pride in always improving our product. We share a vision and commitment to help each other — and our customers — create great work.

We’ve been fully remote since day one. It’s meant we can bring together incredible people from around the world. This commitment to diversity and inclusion means you will be working with developers based everywhere from Scotland to South Africa, and Lithuania to the US.

We encourage our people to be themselves and embrace what makes us unique. We value different backgrounds, perspectives and experience, and we strongly believe this is key to achieving outstanding results.

Besides being distributed, we work asynchronously as much as we can. Our team communicates mostly in writing, using Slack and GitHub. When we need it, we also have video calls.

We have a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and we provide the environment and the tools you need to do your best work.

*   You have experience and enjoy working in product teams.
*   You have excellent **communication skills** and a good written and spoken English.

## What we offer

*   Flexibility to organize your own time, no set hours
