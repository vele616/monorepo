## Description

**Plans of expansion**

We are growing fast to make our mark in the [tax innovation space](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/no-taxation-without-innovation-the-rise-of-tax-startups/) and solving a really hard problem. Fonoa has built a range of products that enable any Internet company to meet their sales tax obligations at scale. We have an API first product that integrates in a matter of hours, enabling any type of Internet company (SaaS, marketplaces, e-commerce, ridesharing etc) to validate transactions, determine tax rates, invoice and report in real time.

In the last 3 months, our team has grown to circa 30 in headcount (from 18), where we are now looking to at least triple the size of our team.
