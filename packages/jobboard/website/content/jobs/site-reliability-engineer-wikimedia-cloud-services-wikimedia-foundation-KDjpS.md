## Site Reliability Engineer, Wikimedia Cloud Services

## Summary

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to join our team, reporting to the manager of Cloud Services. As the Site Reliability Engineer, you will be responsible for maintaining the platforms and services for the Wikimedia Technology Community. In this role, you will maintain, upgrade and add new services to our existing cloud, data, and kubernetes infrastructure.

Come work within the Technology department at the Wikimedia Foundation! [Cloud Services](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Cloud_Services_Introduction) curates environments that host tools and services utilized across Wikimedia projects. A significant portion of edit traffic on Wikipedia for example, is done by community developed tools we host! 

Our team maintains [Infrastructure as a Service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Cloud_VPS), [Platform as a Service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Toolforge), and [Data as a Service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Data_Services) products. The team works in partnership ([our puppet repo is public! And yes, you can contribute to it!](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2011/09/19/ever-wondered-how-the-wikimedia-servers-are-configured/)) with the larger Wikimedia volunteer community to manage these environments.  Candidates should be comfortable communicating in public and asynchronous ways with volunteers and developers from around the world.

You’ll work remotely with a full-time distributed team, with members spread between Europe and North America, and need to overlap (UTC-4 to UTC+2) working hours.  Some examples of the type of work you’ll be doing include:

*   Expanding the capabilities of our toolforge platform and [upgrading kubernetes](https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/05/18/a-better-toolforge-upgrading-the-kubernetes-cluster/)
*   Providing a [curated Jupyter notebook environment](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/PAWS) for data analysis and queries of Wikimedia data
*   Upgrading, customizing, and adding new services to Openstack

And the [backlog](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/832/) has even more details!

## You are responsible for:

*   Performing day-to-day operational tasks on Wikimedia’s Cloud Services infrastructure (deployment, maintenance, configuration, troubleshooting). Develop and support automation tools and processes in support of these tasks.
*   Participating in on-call rotation and support in a 24x7 environment

## Skills and Experience:

*   Comfortable working and thriving within a Linux ecosystem
*   Software development skills in at least one of the following languages: Python, Go, Javascript, and/or Ruby
*   B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science or related field or equivalent in related work experience.

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   Share our [values](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/values/), appreciate our [code of conduct](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct), support our [team norms](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Technical_Engagement/Team_Social_Norms), and work in accordance with all three
*   Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team
*   Support of our users (volunteer and staff developers) using our service offerings
*   Passionate about the value of learning and growing together  

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Interest in open source software projects and communities
*   Utilized configuration management tools such as Puppet, Ansible, Chef, and SaltStack
*   Experience in designing and operating Ceph or similar distributed storage clusters in production environments
*   Built data pipelines and or worked with streaming real time data
*   Used Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos, or similar container orchestration platforms
*   Operated an elastic computing environment such as OpenStack or Cloudstack
*   Operated Open Source database systems like MySQL and Postgres
*   Experience in serverless computing environments
*   Linux systems troubleshooting and debugging skills
