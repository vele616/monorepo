Our 25 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei, and we're proud to be a remote-first company. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we love our core values: Always be Shipping, Own it, Be Customer-Obsessed, and Be Balanced.

We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to build new system and features, improve our existing infrastructure, and ultimately help developers make more money. Our backend is written in Python and relies on PostgreSQL at its core. We believe in test-driven development, code review, and collaborative engineering. We value the reliable and shipped over the exotic.

*   You are a collaborative builder and like to build systems with other engineers in mind
*   You don't scoff at unglamorous engineering tasks, yaks don't shave themselves
*   You are an excellent written and verbal communicator
*   You know when to seek assistance, and it's typically to discuss tradeoffs

## In the first month, you'll:

*   Get up to speed on our architecture and learn the problem domain

*   Begin reviewing code and add to our engineering culture

## In the first three months, you'll:

*   Scope and implement new core features that our customers love
*   Learn the basics of incident response, and be on the server on-call rotation

## In the first six months, you'll:

*   Be the most knowledgeable person on several key features
*   Know all the major components of our system and be able to debug complex issues
*   Have your own initiatives for improving the code base and our infrastructure
*   Be able detect bottlenecks, profile, and come up with enhancements

## Within a year, you'll:

*   Be able to spec, architect, and build any feature we might want to build
*   Mentor other engineers joining the team
*   Know more about PostgreSQL than anyone ever should

## What we offer:

*   $150,000-$170,000 USD salary + competitive equity
