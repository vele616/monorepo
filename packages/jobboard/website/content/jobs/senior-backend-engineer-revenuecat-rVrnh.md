We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to build new system and features, improve our existing infrastructure, and ultimately help developers make more money. Our backend is written in Python and relies on PostgreSQL at its core. We believe in test-driven development, code review, and collaborative engineering.

## In the first three months, you'll:

*   Scope and implement new core features that our customers love
*   Learn the basics of incident response, and be on the server on-call rotation

## In the first six months, you'll:

*   Be the most knowledgeable person on several key features
*   Know all the major components of our system and be able to debug complex issues
*   Have your own initiatives for improving the code base and our infrastructure

## Within a year, you'll:

*   Be able to spec, architect, and build any feature we might want to build
*   Mentor other engineers joining the team
