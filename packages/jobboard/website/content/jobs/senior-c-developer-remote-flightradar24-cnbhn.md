## What you’ll do

*   Develop our back-end systems using modern C++ and Python on a Linux platform, using open source tools like RabbitMQ, Redis, and MySQL, as well as cloud services
*   Improve our flight tracking coverage with semi-embedded C++ development for our global network of Raspberry Pi-based ADS-B receivers (approximately 20,000 devices)
*   Design and implement big data streaming, ingestion, and event processing using both cloud and on-premise SQL and NoSQL systems
*   Expand our flight event detection logic and find new ways to use our data
*   Improve robustness of our systems using cloud infrastructure like AWS and Azure, and tools like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes
*   Apply analytic and algorithmic skills to solve software design and aviation tracking challenges

## Who you are

*   Experienced software engineer with at least 4 years of professional development, ideally in online/web services environments and with similar tech stacks
*   Experience with modern C++ '11-'20, STL and Boost, Python 3, as well as an understanding of data structures, algorithms and their use cases and efficiency
*   Passionate about development best practices and quality efforts, such as test-driven development, unit testing, code reviews, continuous integration, etc.
