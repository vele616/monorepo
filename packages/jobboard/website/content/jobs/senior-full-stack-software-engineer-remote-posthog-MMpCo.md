## Description

**PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world.**

We provide an open source platform for product analytics. The product is new - we launched in February 2020, and have had thousands of deployments organically since we started.

This growth has meant we've been able to raise significant investment from the best in the world, such as YCombinator and GV. We are now looking to grow our engineering team and we are looking for a **Senior** **Full Stack Engineers** to join us!

**The release schedule is wild**

We're up against billion dollar companies, and we're catching up. We will overtake them by being faster.

[Comments like this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22378393) are what we live and die by.

We keep cycles very short. There is a roadmap session, every two weeks - each developer suggests what they want to build to have the greatest impact, then they do just that. You choose what you focus on, and you are responsible for tests, user feedback and tracking.

**The people here are really, really smart**

Every day we feel lucky to have them here!

We're all remote, and we raised enough to pay top of market. Combine those things with working on open source, and you have a recipe for hiring the best engineering talent in the world.

You'd be working with a combination of former CTOs and YC founders all turned developers, alongside some of the best developers from the world's largest tech companies who have the experience to help us handle scalability.

Our team is tiny but we live in 10 different countries. This [diverse group](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity) looks [pretty weird](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team) on paper, but it's magical. Apart from the fact [most of them think pineapple belongs on pizza](https://twitter.com/PostHogHQ/status/1319583079648923648). It doesn't.

_Please note - we are required to add a location to job ads, PostHog is a fully-remote company and you can work from anywhere._

## Requirements

**We can't do this without you**

Our users do not use PostHog for the most complex querying of user data imaginable. We aren't going to use { machine learning | AI | blockchain } any time soon.

The technical challenge here is designing a highly scalable product right out of the box when deployed on premise, supporting a wide breadth of features that give users super powers, and enabling an ecosystem of contributors and plugins from anyone in the world so PostHog becomes a true platform.

Today, PostHog meets simple use cases across a broad part of product development. That reaches from understanding retention, conversion rates, abd feature usage, to feature flags, session recordings, plugins and heatmaps.

You would be a key part in us expanding the range of functionality we are offering, or in supporting its use at scale. We'd want you to suggest ideas that you could take from concept to tests and deployment.

In particular, those with a very strong background in Django, architecture and databases (we use Clickhouse and Postgres) are going to have fun here - we have even individual clients doing hundreds of millions of events a day, but we are _truly_ open to applications from any engineer that thinks they could deliver exceptional work here.
