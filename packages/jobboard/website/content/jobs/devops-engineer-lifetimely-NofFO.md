Lifetimely is a fast-growing B2B SaaS company looking for a DevOps engineer to help build out the infrastructure for our existing analytics product.

You can read about our app on the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/lifetimely-lifetime-value-and-profit-analytics) and on [our website](https://lifetimely.io). We provide real-time reporting and predictions to thousands of ecommerce shop owners. To give you a sense of scale - we collect data on millions of orders per day from a few thousand stores and process many millions of background jobs to be able to deliver quality reports and insights to our customers.

We're looking to add a great DevOps engineer to our existing team.

🔍 We are looking for someone who: 🔍

*   has a track record of building infrastructure with Ansible on-prem or cloud
*   has experience with relational databases
*   worked with Rails (nice to have)
*   humble, can mentor others, both provide and receive direction and is always willing to share what they learn
*   overlaps with EST or CET zone at least 5 hours ( prefer America / Europe / Africa )

## 🔨 What you will do: 🔨

*   build out our infrastructure in Ansible
*   take ownership of uptime and performance of our backend systems
*   improve our monitoring and alerting

☘️ Where we are and how we work: ☘️

Our tech stack is Ansible and Ruby.

Working for Lifetimely doesn't feel like the usual office or startup gig: we are a distributed group of eleven people across ten different countries 🇫🇮 🇺🇸 🇮🇳 🇫🇷 🇨🇱 🇪🇬 🇪🇸 🇮🇶 🇭🇷 🇺🇦 with our own way of working. Some of us are nomads, some just like working remotely. We highly encourage written (long-form) communication and documenting things on Notion and generally don't like tight fixed schedules. There is not really much management or oversight, we expect you to know how to manage yourself. We prioritize shipping and results above how or when you do the work.

Two meetings per week, one for the devs on Tuesday, another one on Thursdays for everyone. That's it. If you are into distributed work, you will enjoy working with us.

You can read more about our company policies here: [](https://www.notion.so/Company-policies-c06aa89ce8884fddb7d3c0c92d5fc1c6)[https://www.notion.so/Company-policies-c06aa89ce8884fddb7d3c0c92d5fc1c6](https://www.notion.so/Company-policies-c06aa89ce8884fddb7d3c0c92d5fc1c6)

## ✉️ To apply, please... ✉️

*   Describe one larger system you managed with Ansible?
*   What was the largest number of Linux servers you had to manage? Describe what the infrastructure was used for.
*   Explain in plain English what a reverse proxy is and why it is needed
