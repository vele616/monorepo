## Overview Of Role: 

We're a fully remote web development agency looking for a contract React Engineer. This position should have an attention to detail and love to develop interactive and engaging websites with React. This person should have a keen eye for engaging animations and clean code. 

## Our mission:

At First + Third, it is our mission to outperform average agencies. We believe that when an agency only thinks about how to get a project done and not enough about the client’s goals, it becomes impossible for the project to be a success.

As an organization we are obsessed with helping our clients understand and achieve their objectives through thoughtful, well-executed web design and development. We are relentless in our pursuit of the very best solution for each individual client and work tirelessly until the desired results are achieved.

As a team, we invest ourselves fully in meeting our client’s goals as if they were our own because when they succeed, we do too. 

Responsibilities:

*   **Execute** - Be able to take visual designs in sketch and written specifications and turn those into React components that are reusable, scalable, performant, accessible and work on all major browsers
*   **Make it move** - We love to create experiences on our pages. We leverage CSS and JavaScript animation to make our pages come alive
*   **Reuse** - Develop React components that are reusable across client projects
*   **Data** \- Develop experiences that pull in data from various APIs

Requirements:

*   2+ years of experience as a React developer.
*   Strong understanding of HTML and CSS including cross-browser compatibility and performance.
*   Ability to write modern and performant Javascript and React.
*   We expect you to know your way around git and Github.
*   Experience with front-end building tools (such as Webpack).
*   Experience working remotely.
*   Comfortable interpreting designs and/or specifications and thinking through the best approach to adapting it to code.
*   A solid understanding of good UX and UI practices for websites.
*   Familiarity with Sketch and Adobe XD.
*   Experience working with component systems.
*   Estimating work for a project and taking specs and turning into clearly defined, executable tasks.

Nice to haves:

*   Experience with React Native
*   Experience with WordPress
*   Experience with Node.js
*   Experience with Shopify
*   Understanding of WCAG accessibility compliance. Ability to implement accessibility standards as well as audit existing websites.

## Join Our Team!

If this sounds like it would be a good fit for you, we’d love to hear from you. Here’s how the process works: 

*   **Apply:** Introduce yourself and let us know a little about yourself. Please include a resume and a summary of a recent project/product you built. 
*   **We’ll Get Together:** Virtually of course, we’ll set up a time to get to know each other, ask questions, and make sure we’re both a good fit for one another. 
*   **Take a look at work:** We like to get a sense of how you approach a problem so we’ll give you a quick project to complete.
*   **Succeed Together:** We’ll get to work helping our clients reach their goals because when they succeed, we do too.
