You’ll be joining our team in building our apps and pushing the bar by building new features.

We typically use a Ruby(-on-Rails), React stack that we host on AWS. We like well-structured light-weight code that’s easy to understand and to work with. We have a clearly defined product development process and work from detailed interaction designs.

During the daily standups we share our progress and discuss next tasks. It’s also a great moment for sharing knowledge and challenges.

You have a lot of autonomy with regards to deciding what the best solution is for the tasks you work on.

*   Friday afternoon drinks and/or (theme)parties (when COVID allows)

You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here.

We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams’ effectiveness & happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.
