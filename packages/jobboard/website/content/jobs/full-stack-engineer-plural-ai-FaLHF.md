## Job description

Plural AI is solving the problem of knowledge management and research for complex use cases. Like Airtable, Roam, Notion, and other next-gen productivity tools, we build apps with modern UI that let users visualise and explore their data interactively. That data is currently spread across thousands of documents, so we merge it into a single knowledge base that end-users can effortlessly explore, visualise, and gain insights from, all without requiring any skills in data science or programming.

You willjoin our Rapid Innovation team, designing and shipping new features multiple times a day to our existing customers, and working with incoming customers to explore new ideas for the product. Your own work will be rich and varied, with the chance to work on many areas, including: data manipulation, systems engineering, 2D/3D visualization, and back-end scaling. The team is a mix of design (product manager, UI designer, UX/information designer) and engineering (full-stack and front-end JS engineers).

We expect you to be good at picking up new ideas and running with them, even for areas you’ve never worked in before. We have strong technical leadership providing guidance and mentoring, but this role suits someone with a 'Pioneer' mentality who enjoys innovating and rapidly exploring ideas themselves. We’re growing fast and this role can grow in several different directions - it will be up to you to help shape that growth and define the future role.

## Tech stack

Core:

*   React + Typescript
*   Node.js + Python
*   Postgres (relational) + Neo4j (graph)
*   AWS (mainly ECS with lambda)

Flexible / future:

*   Elasticsearch
*   CircleCI
*   Golang

## Job requirements

*   3y+ experience in a directly relevant / similar senior role (full-stack engineering)
*   Experience shipping greenfield products and involvement in end-to-end product lifecycle
*   Commercially aware and product-minded
*   Experience with JavaScript/TypeScript/React andPython
*   Experience withScrum/Agile
*   Strong communication and English skills
