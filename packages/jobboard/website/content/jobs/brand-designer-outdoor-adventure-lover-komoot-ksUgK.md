## Description

**Komoot is an app that lets you find, plan, and share adventures with the easy route planner. Driven by a desire to explore, and powered by the outdoor community’s recommendations, it’s komoot’s mission to inspire great adventures, making them accessible to all. And we’re good at it! Google and Apple have listed us as one of their Apps of the Year numerous times - and with 17+ million users and 100,000 five-star reviews - komoot is on the way to becoming the most popular cycling and hiking app for people who love adventures worldwide.**

With increasing numbers of eyes on us, it’s time to elevate the komoot brand. We’re looking for a passionate designer with a background in marketing and branding to help us in our mission to establish komoot as the world’s most-loved outdoor brand.

Join our fully remote team and change the way people explore!

**About the role**

As our new brand designer you will help us build the most loved, lived and relatable brand in the outdoor community. You’ll join a kick ass team which gets to play with generous media, ads and community event budgets – a job every sane communication designer would want, and one every talented designer deserves! With over 17 million users, our platform ensures your work will be seen and heard.

Ready for your next adventure?

**What you will do**

*   Team up with our design team to create brand assets and campaigns for a wide variety of uses and mediums.
*   Design and implement beautiful campaigns to inspire millions of outdoor enthusiasts.
*   Use your various design skills for a diverse range of communication assets — such as campaign landing pages, social media assets, and mobile ads.
*   Test and optimize your work to ensure our message reaches our target audience.
*   Working alongside our design and marketing teams, develop and refine our visual language to strengthen our brand identity.

**Why you’ll love it**

*   You’ll work in a flat hierarchy structure, where ideas are heard and implemented without multiple levels of gatekeeping.
*   You’ll enjoy an environment where creative freedom is valued, and unhindered by client demands or controlling bosses.
*   Your designs will have real impact as you help us in shaping komoot’s emerging brand identity.
*   You have the freedom to organize yourself the way you work best, using the tools you love.
*   Your work will inspire millions of cyclists, hikers and outdoor enthusiasts all over the world.
*   We let you work from wherever you want, be it a beach, the mountains, our headquarters in Potsdam or anywhere that lies between the time zones UTC-1 and UTC+3.
