Revieve is a market-leading beauty-technology company partnered with 100+ global brands on 4 continents building the new standard of commerce across skin, beauty, health and wellness. We enable brands and retailers to drive their customer-experience leveraging AI, AR and Computer-Vision. We've been fortunate to partner with world-leading brands including ULTA, Shiseido, Unilever and others to drive business results.

## Who are we looking for?

As the global industry leader, we're looking for new Account Management Director to drive sales within our existing partnerships. Working as a key member of the Sales team, you’ll be responsible of leading the team of Account Managers and expanding our strategic accounts.

You have 7+ years of experience with enterprise software sales in SaaS, Retail, Software or Tech account management and know what it's like to work in a fast-growing company. You must have experience in a similar role, managing teams and account management of enterprise accounts, and understanding technology/software like the back of your hands. You’ll be responsible for all aspects of key customer relationships and growing the large corporate accounts.

Since we’re a geographically distributed team, we expect you to be a great communicator and an absolute team player. Fluent English is a must + having other language skills like French is considered a bonus.

The position location is flexible within US and Finland (other European countries can be considered too).

## Who are we?

We’re a group of creative minds and growth-minded action-takers. We’re proud of the work we do and inspired by the people we work with. Although we are organized in different departments, many of us wear multiple hats and thrive in the ability to learn new things and grow, both professionally as well as personally.

We’re inherently global with a diverse team of about 50 people representing 19 nationalities across 4 continents and 8 different time zones.

## So what's the deal?

We’re leading the next generation of personalized experiences in Health, Beauty and Wellness commerce and we want you on it. We guarantee it will be challenging, but rewarding beyond imagination. We’re offering an active part in a truly transformative, market-leading tech firm with an international atmosphere, not to mention a competitive compensation package and great perks.

If you join us, you'll be able to enjoy being part of a fast-paced environment where we get stuff done and are fully aligned on a shared vision.

Intrigued? We look forward to hearing from you!
