## At Hopin, we’re reimagining virtual events.

As the first all-in-one virtual venue for live online events, Hopin brings people together in a highly interactive and engaging online experience that feels just like an in-person event, only without the barriers. Whether it’s a 50-person meetup, or a 50,000-person conference—any type of event organizer can host a Hopin event for their attendees, speakers, sponsors, and vendors to convene, learn, and interact face-to-face online. We’re spearheading the innovative technology that is enabling people to gather online like never before.

Our mission is simple: **_better connections for a better planet_**. 

We believe in events without limits, but events that are sustainable and accessible to everyone—and fun, too! To do this, we need passionate builders and storytellers to join us. Do you love people and technology and the magic that happens when they converge at scale? Do you have the skills and experience we’re looking for to better serve our clients? If so, we’d like to meet.

We’ve recently been funded by IVP, Accel, Northzone, Seedcamp, Slack Fund and a number of high-profile angel investors participated, including Supercell founder Ilkka Paananen, UiPath founder Daniel Dines, Intercom founder Des Traynor, GoCardless COO Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas and Miro founder Andrey Khusid.

## The Role

The People Team is growing as the company scales fast. We need to make decisions based on data. We need to be able to query data, build models, produce ad-hoc analyses, and experiment. That’s where the newly created People Analytics function comes in. Since we will be using data for reporting,  for analysing, for predicting and for prescribing, we need it to be readily available, consistent and reliable. 

We need a tech partner in the people team, someone with a passion for scripting as well as for anything data. You will be the person bridging the gap between engineering and people from a technical perspective. You will be bringing efficiency to our data access and use and ensuring data is clean. At times, as we change technologies, we might need to migrate data or  we will need tools to speak to each other - for that we expect some coding skills to integrate APIs.
