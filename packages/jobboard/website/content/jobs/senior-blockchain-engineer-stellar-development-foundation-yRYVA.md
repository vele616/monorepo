*   You're a great communicator that can advocate and lead technical discussions, especially during the design and code review process.
*   You have a solid understanding of software design patterns, and how to build components that are reusable, extensible, and modular.
*   You are knowledgeable of best practices and development tools and are passionate about technological innovation.
*   You have a passion for performance debugging and benchmarking.
*   You love a good challenge in an ever-evolving space - many of the challenges we face are being faced for the first time!
*   You're enthusiastic about working on a small, growing team where you'll be given a lot of autonomy.
*   You're open, empathetic, and care about putting the best ideas forward in a collaborative and helpful manner.

## Bonus points if:
