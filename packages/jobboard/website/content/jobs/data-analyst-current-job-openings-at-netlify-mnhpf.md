## Company Overview

At [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/about/), we're building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We're aiming to change the landscape of modern web development. 

We recently raised $53M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. This round was led by the EQT Ventures with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz & Kleiner Perkins. This brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $107M to date. Other past investors include Bloomberg Beta, Designer Fund, and Tank Hill Ventures, as well as the founders of Figma, GitHub, Slack and Yelp.

Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world. We’re ~44% woman or non-binary, and are composed of about half as many nationalities as we are team members.

## About the role: 

At Netlify, our data team exists to empower the entire organization to make the best decisions possible by providing accurate, timely, and useful insights. We build our data infrastructure as a product instead of just a service, with the ability to make a significant impact.

We’ve been remote-first since our inception and are a globally distributed team, spanning across North America and Europe. We’re biased towards asynchronous planning and communication, meaning less meetings and more execution. We take documentation seriously and place our values of transparency, empowerment, and commitment at the forefront of everything we do. We’re driven by passion and we make sure that everyone on the team knows their value, feels ownership over their work, and can quickly see the impact of their efforts. Beyond just hiring smart, empathetic team members, we foster a culture where there are no dumb questions and our team can get access to the resources that they need to continue to learn. As a remote-first company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Netlify is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life.

**We’re in the beginning stages of building out the foundation of our data team, so as a Data Analyst, you’ll be in an imperative position working closely with stakeholders to educate and empower them to use data as an analytic tool. With our team, you'll be turning rows and columns in a data warehouse into powerful business insights that can be used to make impactful decisions. This role will be providing crucial analyses that are accurate, reliable, reproducible, and is easily accessible to help impact the rest of the business. We think of Data analysts as business partners for their domains of expertise. Please note: This is a SQL-first role, not an Excel-first role.**
