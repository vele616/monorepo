## Description

At Fonoa, we automate taxes for the internet economy. If you want to launch a business today, there are plenty of products out there to help you get going - from Stripe for payments to Twilio for customer engagement.

How come figuring out taxes is so hard? Why isn’t there an easy way to implement a solution to handle all your taxes on products and services sold worldwide?

Enter Fonoa.

Our product suite enables determining indirect tax rates on any sales transaction, creating localized compliant receipts & invoices, and reporting them to tax authorities.

Our mission is to automate repetitive and fragmented manual tasks conducted by finance teams and developers via an easy to use API.

We are expanding our global presence and looking for many new team members to join us!

## About the role

We are looking for an engineer proficient in CI/CD methodologies, experienced with public cloud and scripting languages, to join our distributed (remote) team.

In your role, you will be in charge of designing, implementing, and improving our cloud infrastructure to support our microservices platform. Keeping our service fast, reliable, and secure while using the latest technology and processes is of utmost importance.

At Fonoa, you'll work to enable our product and engineering teams to spin up, maintain, and monitor the necessary infrastructure they need to run our applications and services.

The ideal candidate has a background in developing distributed applications, cloud technologies, and delivering self-service infrastructure.

As our first SRE / Platform Engineer, you’ll get the opportunity to choose and implement a variety of cool technologies that will help us improve and streamline our infrastructure and processes.

We are solving one of the largest yet unsolved problems in global e-commerce and looking for engineers with a hunger for a new challenge and drive to solve a ubiquitous problem for companies selling globally. Our clients range from world-leading marketplaces, e-commerce, delivery to household-name mobility companies.

*   Performance - ensure we have optimized our infrastructure taking into account our product needs, pricing, scalability, smooth customer and developer experience
*   Security - ensure we continuously improve our security by leveraging best practices and tools available
*   Automation - develop our automated CI/CD, packaging, deployment and execution environment infrastructure (scaling, recovery, etc.)

*   3+ years of experience on CI/CD with tools such as Travis, Gitlab, AWS, Azure, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.) and methodologies
