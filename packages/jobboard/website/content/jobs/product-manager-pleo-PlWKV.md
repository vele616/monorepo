If you're interested in the classic Product Manager role then maybe this posting isn’t for you. But then again, what is a "classic" PM even?🤷‍♂️

What makes this unconventional role even more unconventional?

Working on a product without a product of course! Or plenty of products at the same time. It is about Growth and how we envision it in a productised way.

We’re proud of our product, customers and end users love it and so do we. So the question is:

How do we use the product with all its happy customers to bring in new customers and engage less active current ones?

It resembles growth hacking in a way but we’re not in a business of hacking our way if it means sacrificing good user experience (also the term growth hacking by now is a bit 🤢). So we hope you share the vision of accomplishing this growth through focusing on solving problems more related to learning about Pleo and being able to easily try it out!

In all we do, we challenge the nature of work: with the product that we build for our customers – specifically expense management, but also internally; we see every function as a potential product. In case of growth we're changing it from sales-led to product-led and the limits are only up to imaginations of you and our team.

We want you to spearhead the change and help transform Pleo’s growth to a product-led way.

Any idea that can bring SQLs using the product itself worth exploring could be on the table. Data comms, AB testing, a great referral scheme — you name it. One thing is for sure, the impact of this role will be transformative for the future of Pleo.

## We'll geek out if you

*   Have worked in a similar role ensuring product-led growth
*   You've built successful (financial) products using data, customer feedback, common sense
*   Are in on the mission of helping companies make their employees feel valued ✌️

## Your colleagues say

*   You are entrepreneurial - and have a lot of light bulb moments 💡
*   Are easy to work with and a person they would also enjoy having a coffee with (virtual or not)
*   Challenge the status quo, and give good arguments why
*   Can't stop talking about product and fintech trends
*   Listen to feedback but is strong enough to drive your own vision

## Your mom says

*   You are too productive and efficient - you get things done
*   You know way too much about everything
*   Played with Lego as a kid and built things
*   You always ask why
*   Take on challenges happily
*   Probably work in IT (moms)

## And here are some nice gestures that we do

*   Get your own Pleo card, which means full autonomy and no out-of-pocket spending
*   Ability to work remotely (anywhere between east coast of the Americas to European timezones)...
*   ...or onsite if you want to (Copenhagen, London, Berlin, Stockholm, Madrid)
*   Catered lunch in our offices
*   25 days of annual holidays, on top of the standardised festive and bank-related ones, of course
*   Great parental leave: 100% paid, 24 weeks for mums & 8 weeks for dads
*   Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company
*   Once a quarter – in any normal year – our entire company gets together at a team camp.
*   Continual learning and development opportunities
*   Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food etc)

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech, we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending.
