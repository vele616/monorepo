**Who We Are**

Red Canary was founded to create a world where every organization can make its greatest impact without fear of cyber attack. Our combination of market-defining technology, processes, and expertise are preventing breaches every day. We are completely changing the way security is delivered and setting the new standard for security. If our mission resonates with you, let’s talk!  

**What We Believe In**

\- Do what’s right for the customer

\- Be kind and authentic

\- Deliver great quality

\- Be relentless

**Challenges You Will Solve**

The Short-Term Engagements team extends Red Canary’s charge of making security better for every business to consulting organizations; where we augment our partners’ capabilities using a unique combination of operations, threat research, and engineering to deliver more effective engagements.

Your team is the muscle behind our consulting partner’s experience using Red Canary for Consulting. From security advice on EDR deployments to urgent engineering requests in the thick of a ransomware case, your team is the technical liaison between our consultant partner’s operations and Red Canary. You’ll also be acting as the functional leader for the Technical Account Management team with the responsibility of managing, coaching, and mentoring highly technical direct reports and championing operational initiatives that make our partners better.

Adversaries are continually evolving and attacking businesses - and your team is the tip of the spear. 

**Who You Are**

You love building relationships -- with your directs, peers, prospective partners, and definitely your customers. You’ve got a knack for identifying customer needs and are always looking to maximize their experience using your product. Perhaps you’ve been known to champion an initiative or three on their behalf? Managing and creating projects that require involvement across multiple teams is second nature, especially to support your customers.

You know management isn’t suited for everyone, but it’s definitely for you. Working with a highly technical team excites you, and you’re confidently able to provide both investigative coaching and managerial feedback. In fact, you’ve probably got a stack of old DFIR books on your shelf, and are completely comfortable nerding out about security controls or some investigative details from a previous incident as a technical expert.

You take pride in being able to build highly effective teams, using carefully crafted metrics as your guide to operational excellence. You know how to prioritize customer issues, and the difference between what a customer is asking for and what makes a good feature request for a platform.

Ultimately, you’re passionate about supporting security consultants and ensuring that together we can respond to and remediate the most advanced compromises impacting our shared customers. 

## What You'll Do

*   Be the leader for our Technical Account Management team, responsible for managing the overall success of our operational relationships with consulting partners. 
*   Manage, mentor, and coach technical direct reports

*   Drive and create operational initiatives across multiple teams to enhance consulting partner experience

## What You'll Bring

*   5+ years experience working in a Security Operations Center (SOC) or performing Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), at least 1 of which was operating in a managerial capacity
*   Proficiency in managing relationships with senior leadership at technology companies
*   Relentless advocate for customer needs, and ability to manage effective relationships with organizational leaders and drive initiatives to completion
*   Unshakeable desire to mentor, coach, and manage highly technical direct and indirect reports
*   Proficiency creating and managing operational metrics that increase team efficiencies and quality
*   Experience working within high-pressure environments and acting as an escalation for customers
*   Technical understanding of core security controls, specifically system-level controls
*   Exceptional verbal and written communication skills

*   Interest in speaking at conferences and/or research-driven reports preferred
