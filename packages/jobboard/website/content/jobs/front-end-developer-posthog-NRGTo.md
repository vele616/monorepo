## Description

**We're looking for a Front End Developer to join our [Website & Docs team](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/design).**

Our goal is to create a world-class developer experience, and you'll be crucial in making that happen.

At PostHog, we empower customers to create successful products. Until now, tools for building products have been very fragmented - product analytics, heatmaps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together. PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that customers can host themselves.

We are fully remote and our team of 22 is currently distributed across 9 countries. We are extremely [transparent](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#extremely-transparent), we [write everything down](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#we-write-everything-down) and we are structured to optimize for [autonomy and impact](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#structured-for-speed-and-autonomy). Also - [everybody codes](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#everyone-codes)!

The role

As our team's first Front End Developer, you'll:

*   Be responsible for the codebase that powers our [website](https://posthog.com/), [docs](https://posthog.com/docs) and [public handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) - they receive hundreds of thousands of pageviews each month!
*   Maintain, refactor and enforce best practices on our [Gatsby-powered website](https://github.com/posthog/posthog.com)
*   Review PRs by other team members who are modifying our Docs and Handbook
*   Build out updated marketing designs (Figma → Gatsby + Tailwind)
*   Implement tests to optimize for conversion - using PostHog!

## Requirements

## What can set you apart

**A critical eye for design**

Knowing the fundamentals of typography and webfonts, whitespace, antialiasing, etc is valuable. You don’t have to be a designer, but you should care about the details that make it into our mocks.

**Ability to infer how designs should change at different breakpoints**

There will be cases where we don’t have explicit designs for every screen size. Being able to make an educated decision about how a design should reflow (or knowing the right time to ask for clarification) is incredibly useful in this role.

**Working knowledge of Figma**

You should understand how components and variants work, and be comfortable digging in to export elements. Additionally, the ability to make elements “production-ready” is critical. Our designers do their best to package design elements so they’re easy to export, but there may be cases where it will be useful to roll up your sleeves in Figma to create a few slices.

**SVGs and SVG spriting**

Optimizing our website is important. Experience in using build tools to package various assets to reduce our website’s overall footprint is handy. Preference for SVG sprites over icon fonts strongly preferred!

**Animation experience**

While not a requirement, experience (or interest) in animating for the web will extend our ability to create an incredibly polished site. For example on our homepage, we may want to add twinkling stars, animated icons when hovering them, a parallax effect with the sun or moon, or even the occasional shooting star.

**Experience with:**

*   State management solutions like TypeScript, Redux
*   NodeJS, GraphQL

This role requires more than HTML and CSS. Here’s our stack (and the skills needed to thrive in this role):

*   HTML/Sass (obviously) =\]
*   Tailwind
*   Gatsby
*   React
*   Figma
*   Netlify

## Benefits

**What we offer in return:**

*   Generous, transparent [compensation](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation) and employee-friendly [equity](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation) in PostHog
*   [Unlimited time off](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
*   Private [health insurance](https://posthog.com/careers#benefits) including dental and vision
*   [401k contributions](https://posthog.com/careers)
*   [Generous parental leave](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off)
*   [Training budget](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/training) and [free books](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/training)
*   [$200/month budget towards co-working or café working](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money#work-space)
*   [Spill mental health chat](https://posthog.com/careers)
*   Regular in-person [get-togethers](https://posthog.com/careers#benefits) with the team (once Covid allows us to travel)
*   Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/)
