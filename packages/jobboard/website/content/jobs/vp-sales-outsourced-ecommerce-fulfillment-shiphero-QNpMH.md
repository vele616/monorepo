ShipHero is an 8 year old company. We've built the company with a product and engineering focus and a focus on profitability. We care about our customers and helping them succeed. We've been a distributed company since we started and we have team members around the US as well as Argentina, Canada, Spain, New Zealand and more. There is no office.

We have a talented, hard working and loyal team. If you join, you can expect to work hard, but with helpful team mates and lots of down time. We believe aly in asynchronous work. You won't have people slacking you at dinner time unless there is a real and urgent issue tasks and there is a a focus on long form written communication. Think writing a 3 paragraph email about the issue you're trying to solve, not a dozen one sentence slack messages. We believe in asynchronous work because we believe focussed time is important. The team across all levels of the organization is extremely talented and we have very low employee turn over. You will report to the COO.
