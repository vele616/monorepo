[](https://www.notion.so/vinteriorhq/Vinterior-ba2940b7744a4ec180b8a4d5f07c7e21)**About the job**

We are currently seeking a talented Senior Product Data Analyst to help us make better decisions in the Product team. This will be the first time we have hired for this role so there will be plenty of opportunities to make this role your own and leave your mark. You will help us make sense of the data and establish the facts. You will help us understand the business and our customers, ultimately improving the product for our users.

Example projects/tasks

*   Designing, monitoring, analysing and reporting on experiments with statistical rigor. Working with small independent squads to analyse the impact of the work they are delivering.
*   Supporting product strategy and prioritisation by analysing product usage data to figure out how our product is being used and where problems/opportunities are.
*   Work on the planning track with the stakeholders of Objectives to help them set KPIs that capture the success of the objective and will be easy to measure.
*   Reporting: producing ad hoc reports and dashboards for the product team, managing recurring product team reports and making data more accessible across the company by publishing relevant reports.
*   Develop customer understanding in the team by building a deep and nuanced understanding of the full user lifecycle yourself and working with our product designer to produce UX personas backed up by data.
*   Writing Look ML to improve our BI visualisation capabilities inside of Looker and writing data transformations in SQL to build out our data model.
*   Work with our Engineering team to ensure that we have the necessary tracking and ensure that our data pipelines are consistently accurate, reliable and up-to-date.
*   Training others throughout the product team on how to access data unaided and provide informed advice to the team on how best to approach data-related problems.
*   Setting data best practices: helping to develop our processes in the product team around data and make recommendations on product analytics tooling choices.
*   Help us to organise our reports and raw data so that it's easy for team members to access and leverage for future decision making. Making implicit knowledge explicit by documenting processes, key insights and decisions regularly.
*   Help us to understand the correlation between leading moveable metrics and our top-line lagging metrics and working with product squads to launch experiments that can prove a cause and effect relationship between these metrics.
*   Working with the Engineering team to understand how we can leverage data-driven technologies (such as ML) to create more value for our customers.

That’s a lot of different areas of responsibility! We know you won’t be an expert in all of them, and that’s ok. A solid approach to analysis and problem solving will pave the way.

**Tools & tech you will use**

*   Looker
*   SQL
*   GA
*   BigQuery
*   Spreadsheets
*   Funnel IO
*   Stitch
*   Snowplow
*   Algolia

## Requirements

**We’re looking for an experienced candidate that...**

*   Has at least 5 years of experience doing similar work elsewhere (as you’ll be the only one in the team with this specialty), preferably in a digital marketplace startup.
*   Is comfortable self-directing scope of work, setting timelines independently and has a proactive attitude to work.
*   Is prepared to be the point of contact for all things data and manage ambiguity around data in the team.
*   Has strong proficiency in SQL and the ability to work with large, complex and sometimes fragmented datasets
*   Enjoys collaborating with others and understands the value of interdisciplinary collaboration to produce great work in a Product team.
*   Has excellent written and verbal communication skills. The ability to communicate complex problems and analysis simply with a variety of stakeholders, acting as a bridge between technical and non-technical colleagues is key.
*   Is committed to learning and continuous improvement.

**Bonus points if you have any of the following...**

*   Proficiency in Python.
*   Experience managing software projects and are able to run small self-organised teams.

You can expect to hear back from us within roughly 1 to 2 weeks.

We'll organise a take-home assessment that will involve you writing up your approach to some of the example projects/tasks outlined in the description of the job. Imagine you’re doing the work and walk us through your thinking.

Finally, there will be a culture and values assessment with one of our Founders and our Head of Engineering.

If all goes well we will make an offer to you as soon as possible.
