## Job description

## Attention, SEO wizards! There is an exciting career opportunity on the optimisation horizon!

![](https://recruitee-main.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/l67es2esv6/Opcija_eng.jpg)

With more high-profile clients and exciting projects than ever before, our SEO department needs some strong backup! We're a dream team of 5 specialists and enthusiasts who are proud to continue the strong tradition of optimisation, a service that has been at the heart of Optiweb since its very beginnings. With experts ranging from analytics geeks to content marketing strategists, no SEO challenge is off-limits for us.

Among our top-priority clients, you will currently find Inotherm, Atlantic Grupa, MASS Shoes, Optius (Moja zaposlitev) and many others. If you'd like to help us to take even better care of them, here's what you need above all else: a true passion for optimisation and the willingness to grow! Why? Because the world of technical SEO is developing way too fast for someone to only rely on several years of past experience. In other words: avid explorers, fast learners and inventive minds, if you are ready to roll up your sleeves, this is your chance!

## Your ranking wizardry will be needed for the following challenges:

*   conducting technical SEO audits and presenting results directly to clients;
*   creating analysis reports and developing long-term technical optimisation strategies;
*   detecting common technical errors (broken links, HTTPS/HTTP mixed content, redirect chains etc.) and assisting developers in removing them;
*   monitoring clients' page speed results, schema markup implementation and possible issues in Google Search Console;
*   ensuring that Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts of all clients are properly configured;
*   supporting our content marketing projects with keyword analyses and interlinking suggestion;
*   working closely with experts from other teams to exchange knowledge and ideas (meetings, workshops etc.).

## Job requirements

## Does this task list match your search intent? Great! Let's see what other skills make you rank well among our candidate search results!

*   at least 2 years of prior SEO experience (working with international clients is a plus);
*   experience with Google Analytics (such as setting up event tracking, filters, and segmenting data), Google Search Console, Google Tag Manager and Google Data Studio;
*   experience with SEO tools such as SEMRush, Ahrefs, Screaming Frog etc.;
*   ability to investigate changes in organic (and other) traffic to deliver insights and improvement recommendations;
*   good understanding of Technical SEO (website architecture, sitemaps, robots.txt best practices, crawl budget, canonicalization, Schema.org, etc.);
*   great communication and English language skills as well as strategic thinking;
*   basic development experience (not necessary but a big plus).

## And what can you expect if you outrank all other candidates?

*   a safe and stable job at company-owned headquarters (we own 99% of expensive company equipment, which you also get, the company has 1 owner, who is also the CEO, 96% of workers have a contract of indefinite duration);
*   a dynamic work environment with some of the biggest Slovenian and foreign companies and an opportunity to work in a diverse team consisting of professionals from various fields, enabling you to really broaden your horizons;
*   great mentorship program with your dedicated mentor;
*   training and conference attendance;
*   the best team building with new experiences;
*   a flexible schedule along with the option to work remotely and assistance with setting up your home office - but we will be always happy to see you in our cosy and high-tech offices with a view of Škofja Loka’s iconic old town centre (only 25 minutes drive from Ljubljana - and totally worth it). ;)

Are you ready to boost those rankings with the best team by your side? Don’t miss the deadline to apply (**May 30, 2021**)!
