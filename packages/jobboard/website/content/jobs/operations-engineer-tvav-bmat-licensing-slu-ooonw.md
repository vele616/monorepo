## About BMAT 

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, Tel-Aviv, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.

## Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

## Job Summary

As part of the TV&AV Engineering Team, your responsibilities will be to operate, maintain and evolve our platform dedicated to the reporting of the use of music within audiovisual productions in TVs.

You will be working on a modular and scalable platform that is connected to both each clients’ systems and a number of other internal BMAT applications, allowing us to efficiently identify, aggregate and report all music usages in real time. 

As an Operations Engineer, you will work alongside the Operations team, who are in daily contact with our customers, and the Engineering team, who plan and execute mid/long term developments. Your objective, working side by side with the Operations team, is to offer the best service experience to our clients and develop and improve any solutions to satisfy their day to day needs.

Your responsibilities can range from extracting concrete information from our databases, generating reports, resolving daily issues, to developing new tools in order to scale repeated tasks.

## All About You 

*   You know Python 3 and some of its frameworks (flask and celery would be valuable) and you are eager to get better.
*   You have an instinct for listening, asking, understanding and communicating.
*   You are comfortable querying MongoDB.
*   Some experience with docker and elasticsearch will help you solve some tasks faster.
*   You are comfortable handling complex structured data formats (e.g. XML, JSON) and can validate the file based on its schema (e.g. XSD).
*   Bash knowledge can convert complicated tasks to one-liners.
*   You think uncertainty creates opportunity rather than stress.
*   You have used AWS and know some of its core components.
*   Starting a debugger is the first thing that comes to mind when tackling a bug.
*   DRY principles are important to you.
*   Refactoring doesn't scare you.

##   You Can Enjoy 

*   Full-time job.
*   Flexibility on working hours, home office and remote working.  
    
*   Spanish and English classes.
*   Wide range of online and onsite courses.
*   Possibility to choose your hardware and tools.  
    
*   Becoming part of a diverse and multicultural team based in Barcelona obsessed with bettering the music industry.

Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.
