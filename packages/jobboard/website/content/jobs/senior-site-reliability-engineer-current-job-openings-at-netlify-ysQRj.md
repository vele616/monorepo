## Company Overview

At Netlify, we’re building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development. Netlify currently serves more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide.

Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world. We’re ~44% woman or non-binary, and are composed of more than a fourth as many nationalities as we are team members.

We recently raised $63M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. Among our investors are Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, EQT Ventures as well as the founders of GitHub, Slack, Figma  and Yelp. This latest round brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $107M to date.

About the Opportunity:

The mission of our SRE team is to scale Netlify’s infrastructure for the next million users. Our team is dedicated to ensuring application resiliency and delivering the compute and network platform at scale. 

As a member of the SRE team, you will design, develop and deliver solutions that enhance the scalability, availability, and efficiency of our products. Our tech stack includes (but is not limited to) Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Kafka, CDN and Golang based microservices. Whether you're a seasoned systems developer or a software developer that wants to focus on systems, we want to hear from you!

Our team consists primarily of senior level engineers that you’ll be continuing to learn from. We are a remote-first, globally distributed team and are biased towards asynchronous planning and communication, meaning less meetings and more execution. We take documentation seriously and place our values of transparency, empowerment, and commitment at the forefront of everything we do. We’re driven by passion and we make sure that everyone on the team knows their value, feels ownership over their work, and can quickly see the impact of their efforts. Beyond just hiring smart, empathetic team members, we foster a culture where there are no dumb questions and our team can get access to the resources that they need to continue to learn. As a remote-first company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Netlify is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life.
