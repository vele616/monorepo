## Job description

## About Perdoo

We're an ambitious, diverse, and fun team excited about building a tool to help companies and their people achieve awesome results.

Perdoo is a simple but powerful goal management platform that enables organizations to keep track of strategy, OKRs, KPIs, and more. We make businesses more transparent, more aligned, and more agile — by fixing the broken link between strategy and execution.

Companies like Calendly, Flaconi, and Rewe already use Perdoo to achieve amazing things and accelerate their growth.

## The role

As a Full Stack Web Engineer (f/m/div), you’ll be working very closely with our CTO to architect solutions and build them from end-to-end, including having conversations with product, design, and support to pull everything together. We’re looking for someone who’s excited about working in a small team to bring our technology to the next level and is passionate about building products that last.We’re looking for someone with strong React skills that wants to grow into a Full Stack Engineer. Experience with backend projects (particularly using Django) is a huge plus, but not necessarily required as long as you’re able and willing to learn quickly and on-the-job.

## As our Full Stack Web Engineer you’ll:

*   Build and architect Perdoo end-to-end, ensuring that it is secure, fast and reliable for our customers
*   Work in an agile team and continuously refine our own processes for maximum efficiency and fun
*   Ensure our stack is scalable and state of the art, staying on top of the latest technologies we can take advantage of
*   Automate most of our testing to keep both new and existing parts of our app stable and bug free
*   Help yourself and others maintain and improve their quality of work through code reviews

## Requirements

****Required Skills / Experience****

If you care a lot about what you do, creating the workplace of tomorrow and having a real impact on the company's success, then Perdoo is the right place for you.

*   You love what you do and believe in what we’re building here at Perdoo.
*   4+ years of full-time, professional, web development experience. Work on Web products/apps (typically SaaS) is a plus.
*   Strong React skills are a must. Experience with Apollo Client, GraphQL and Django are a huge plus.
*   If you’re planning to work remotely, at least one year of experience in doing so.
*   Strong communicator (both written and oral), independent, self-starter, willing to learn!

## What we offer

*   The ability to work remotely.
*   Contribute to a real-life product used by thousands of users every day.
*   Work in a dynamic, exciting and fun startup environment where every person has a voice and can have a real impact on company success.
*   Flexible working hours, frequent team events and exceptional co-workers.
*   Support for personal development, trainings, conferences and continuous learning.
*   A beautiful office inBerlin with an awesome view over the city.
*   Team retreats twice a year to a remote location. Last time we took the team to a villa in Morocco!
