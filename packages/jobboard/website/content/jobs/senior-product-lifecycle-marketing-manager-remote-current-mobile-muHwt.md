## How We Work

Current is committed to learning, exploring new ideas & alternatives, and is united by curiosity. We are results-driven, use OKRs to guide us on our decisions, and emphasize goal accomplishment.

We put emphasis on the following Values:

*   _Lead with Purpose -_ Leadership does not necessarily mean management. Everyone is a leader, no matter the role. Taking pride in your responsibilities, finding & executing solutions is key.
*   _Focus on the ‘Why’-_ The best solutions start with everyone understanding the problem and its impact. We’ve found that if someone understands the ‘why’, they will produce an innovative ‘what’ and ‘how’. If we cannot explain the ‘why’ clearly, we don’t understand the problem ourselves.
*   _Bring a Sense of Humor -_ Our work environment is a lighthearted & positive place where employees are united by humor and camaraderie; we believe laughter is a great way to uplift employee morale and form bonds with each other.
*   _Set New Precedents -_ We drive innovation and push boundaries for all company activities while understanding that anything worth doing will have roadblocks. We set a new standard of worth for people’s time, data, and attention while rewarding what most other companies take.
*   _Collaboration -_ We won’t thrive without recognizing others strengths. Listen and evolve together, helping and supporting each other for the sake of a collective goal.

## We believe in the following workplace Norms:

*   Honor Commitments, Your Word Matters
*   Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant & Timely (S.M.A.R.T) Asks & Answers
*   Allow OKRs To Guide Us
*   Individual & Departmental OKRs will largely impact success at Current
*   Agree to Disagree & Commit
*   Voice concerns in a respectful & appropriate manner directly to your manager or the Executive Team
