## Description

We are looking for a **Senior Mobile Engineer** to join our extensibility team, which is responsible for maintaining all our various integrations, including for Android and iOS.

At PostHog, we are a small (but growing) remote [team](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/) building an open source platform that empowers customers to create successful products.

Until now, tools for building products have been fragmented, Product analytics, heat maps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together.

PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that customers can host themselves.

We started PostHog as part of Y Combinator’s W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - [with a product that was just 4 weeks old](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/story).

We are proudly backed by some of the world’s top [investors](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let your product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales team and regular cold calls.

We have a lot of capital, but we’re a lean, strong team - so you’ve got the opportunity to have a huge impact.

**What you'll be doing:**

*   Maintaining the integrations between PostHog and various mobile platforms (Android, Android Wear, iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, React Native, Expo, ...)
*   Adding support for new features in existing integrations, e.g. add feature flags into all mobile libraries
*   Building new integrations when needed, for example we need to build a pure-JS Expo (React Native) integration, our current React Native integration uses native code
*   Improving our integration testing and deployment infrastructure
*   Assuring we meet all privacy and compliance requirements set by Apple and Google, so that people using our libraries won't get their apps flagged
*   Work on the rest of the PostHog platform in the Extensibility team, e.g. by improving our plugin server
*   [Tread on toes](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#tread-on-toes) and do whatever else is needed, this might include working on the main PostHog app, fix random issues you encounter, help with infrastructure, anything and everything is possible

## Requirements

**What you'll bring:**

*   At least 4-5 years of Android and iOS development experience, over many iterations of phone operating systems
*   A high level of proficiency in both Java and Objective-C
*   Ideally, you'll have a high level of proficiency in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript

## Benefits

**What we offer in return:**

*   Generous, transparent [compensation](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation) and employee-friendly [equity](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation) in PostHog
*   [Unlimited, permissionless vacation](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
*   Private [health insurance](https://posthog.com/careers#benefits) including dental and vision provided for our team in the UK
*   [Pension contributions](https://posthog.com/careers)
*   [Generous parental leave](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off)
*   [Training budget](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/training) and [free books](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/training)
*   £150[/month budget towards co-working or café working](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money#work-space)
*   [Spill mental health chat](https://posthog.com/careers)
*   Regular in-person [get-togethers](https://posthog.com/careers#benefits) with the team (once Covid allows us to travel)
*   Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/)
