## What is Current Mobile?

Our mission is to enable passive income and access to capital for budget-conscious consumers through their everyday activities. We accomplish this with [a superapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.current.android) and [smartphone](https://modephone.com/) that pay users to listen to music, charge their phone, play games, complete surveys; and connect them with exclusive deals to save and earn even more. You can learn more about us [here](https://currentmobile.us).

We’ve seen 10x user growth in the last year: over 500,000 people earn on Current daily, we pay out over $1M to people each quarter, and are maintaining positive margins at $24M+ run rate.

Our Engineering and Product team works in autonomous, cross-functional pods. Each pod has a Product Manager, 5-7 Engineers, and a QA Engineer rallied around a core part of the product; together they are responsible for defining and achieving a set of OKRs. Our team of 50 is distributed across the globe, with half in Engineering and Product, and with leaders and builders from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intel and numerous startups. We plan to be 80+ people by the end of 2021.

## About the Role

We're looking for an experienced VP of Engineering to help us scale our engineering org from 20-40 people in 2021. This role will report to our CTO, and will have the following responsibility:

*   **Define and execute mid to long-term engineering strategy.** Current’s product, technology, and team are growing quickly. You’ll work with multiple stakeholders to identify opportunities and set a long-term direction to address them. You’ll use OKRs to support the direction, and can communicate them effectively to the whole company.
*   **Manage a growing group of Engineers and Engineering Managers.** You’ll be responsible for software development and infrastructure at Current. You’ll provide world-class management support, coaching, and promote accountability to ensure we build reliable and consistent products, supercharge the personal development of individuals, and spread learnings across the team. You are passionate about making yourself, your org, and the entire company 1% better every day, and you give and receive candid feedback to accomplish that.
*   **Build systems and standards to improve reliability and observability as we scale.** Last year we were focused on keeping up with the user growth. In 2021, we are increasing the reliability and observability of our services to minimize issues, and make it easy to debug when they come up. You’ll approach this from a leadership/management perspective, focusing on creating clear expectations, metrics and systems that empower the team rather than executing the changes yourself.
*   **Hire and retain world-class engineers**. We are doubling our remote-first global team in 2021 to continue accelerating growth. You’ll constantly look out for gaps on the team, and work with our People Ops team to define and execute hiring plans to continue growing a world-class Engineering team.
*   **Partner with other senior leaders**. The company will look to you as the face of the engineering team. You’ll forge close relationships with our Director of Product, VP of Marketing, CTO, and CEO to improve our operations, define OKRs, and filter initiatives to keep the product teams focused.

This is a globally-available position on our remote-first team, with a generous compensation package of base salary, cash bonus, and equity. We also offer healthcare, 401k matching, and other benefits.

## We’d Love To Talk To You If...

*   our mission and company excite you!
*   you’re excited to join a growth-stage startup, and to help level-up the company. Expect some chaos.
*   you have experience leading 20+ people engineering orgs.
*   you have experience managing or directly building mobile applications.
*   you have experience with AWS services, scaling out to hundreds of thousands of active users.
*   you have experience working with other cross-functional executives (Product, People Ops, Finance).
*   you’re passionate about helping your team identify and achieve their career goals.
*   you love to build systems that accomplish constant improvement of yourself, your org, and the entire company.
*   you have a track record of attracting, hiring, and retaining extraordinary engineers and engineering managers.
