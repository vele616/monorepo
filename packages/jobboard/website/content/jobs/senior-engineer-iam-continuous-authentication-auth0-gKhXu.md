Auth0 is a unicorn that just closed a $120M Series F round of funding, with total capital raised to date of $330M and valuation of nearly $2B. We are growing rapidly and looking for exceptional new team members to add to our exceptional talent pool - and who will help take us to the next level of success. One team, one score. 

Our vision is to provide people with secure access to any application in one click or less. And our promise is to make identity work for everyone—whether you’re a developer looking to innovate, or a security professional looking to mitigate. We are looking for curious, excited, boundary-pushing team members. So, if you’re a big thinker who is nimble and adaptable, Auth0 may be an ideal place for you to shine.

**What's the opportunity?**

As we scale Auth0 and handle billions of logins per month, we also have to deal with **billions of attacks**. Almost 40% of our traffic are bots trying to get access to our customers accounts and our job is to not let that happen.

At the same time we want to provide a great experience to our users and let them know when something suspicious is going on: someone logged in from a device that was not seen before; from a place that would be impossible based on previous activity; from a TOR node; etc.

Finding the **right balance between security and user experience** is a hard problem to solve. This is the mission of the Continuous Authentication team.

Did that spark any interest? Read more about our [vision](https://auth0.com/blog/the-developer-first-identity-platform-auth0-story-and-future/) and [how we hire](https://auth0.com/blog/how-we-hire-engineers/).
