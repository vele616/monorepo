## Company Overview

Imagine being part of a nimble team where your ideas and input have the potential to impact millions of lives. IRL aims to solve technology addiction by bringing people together in real life. Our goal is to help our users engage more with friends in-person to boost their overall happiness, encourage curiosity, and make the task of organizing hang outs a breeze.

Our team is focused on building an intuitive social calendar that will be a ‘one stop shop’ for all your calendar, event, and planning needs while still incorporating other platforms and methods of communication. We're looking for self-motivated people who have a passion for building high-quality consumer-facing applications.
