## About BMAT

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, Tel-Aviv, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.

## Our Culture

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

## What will you be doing?

The goals of the LoudSense project are the study of the audibility of music in different audiovisual contexts, and the development of a groundbreaking AI system that is able to automatically estimate it. 

As part of the R&D team, you will work on the development of the environment in which the necessary experiments will take place, on the preparation of these experiments, and on the compilation, annotation and management of all the data that will be used in these experiments. You will also help in the generation of all the documentation related to the project. On top of that, you will be able to collaborate in the design of the Deep Learning models of the proposed solutions, and contribute to other projects that we are carrying out at BMAT. 

This job offer is supported by ACCIÓ (Agència per la Competitivitat de l'Empresa, Generalitat de Catalunya) in the framework of the INNOTEC-2020 call and the project “AI system for automatic audibility estimation of background music in audiovisual productions (LoudSense).”
