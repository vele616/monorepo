## Description

**Why?**

With so many companies transitioning to remote work, we are growing quickly and require a well rounded Strategic Payroll Lead with experience in transforming and automating the function to join the team.

**What?**

You’ll be our Payroll Strategy Lead reporting into the Head of Finance and will be fundamental to the architecture of our core product.

**Who?**

You will have international payroll experience with an in-depth awareness of the data points required to complete accurate payroll globally. You will also have experience transforming the payroll function through the use of technology and automation. Finally, you will have extensive leadership experience and you will have built and lead teams successfully.

**The detail**

**About Omnipresent**

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re cutting this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

**Your role**

The key thing here is that we are a Series A rapidly growing startup and this is a great opportunity to contribute to the development and scalability of our product. You will be responsible for leading the transformation of international payroll at Omnipresent by identifying ways to automate payroll in a scalable manner. You will be integral to the strategy behind our product offering working closely with the Product team to deliver this. In addition, you will build and lead the Payroll team at Omnipresent and ensure that we continue to provide complete, accurate and timely payroll and invoicing to our clients and their employees. Which, to be clear looks like this:

We believe in the potential of everyone; regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic origin, different physical ability, family structure, socio-economics, age, nationality or citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, or gender identity._
