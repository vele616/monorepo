## Job description

Here at Mavenoid, we’re building a platform for _technical_support of _physical_products. Companies use Mavenoid to help their customers install, use, and troubleshoot everything from consumer electronics and home appliances to industrial robots and drones. With some of the world’s most iconic brands as clients and $10 million in funding from leading VC firms, we’re on a journey to make tech support painless. Founded in 2017 by a team from Palantir and Google, today we have offices in New York and Stockholm but have a virtual first, office optional culture with Mavens located all over the US and Europe.

As a Strategic Account Executive, your mission is to grow recurring revenue by turning opportunities into new clients. To do so you’ll work closely with Sales Development, Customer Success, Product, Marketing, and senior leadership.

## Responsibilities

1.  Grow recurring revenue by signing new clients (duh)
2.  Constantly improve the Mavenoid way of selling. Push the envelope in how we demo Mavenoid and pitch by teaching.
3.  Discover and deeply understand customer needs, and capture them in a systematic way
4.  Ensure there are enough opportunities in the pipeline to meet or exceed your targets; at Mavenoid all sales reps prospect
5.  Provide a delightful prospect experience, regardless of deal size or outcome.

## Principles

1.  Slow down to increase your win rate. Be radically customized, personalized, and creative in outreach and prospecting. Research the customer, grok their needs, understand who they are. Then teach them how our product will truly solve their problem.
2.  Deeply understand our product. Know every feature and every use case.
3.  Make every interaction count. Always add value with each email and call.
4.  Engage your prospects even if they don’t want to do a “real sales call” this week. Are we not doing a weekly webinar? Start one, and invite all your prospects each week.
5.  Be radically responsive. No one wants to wait 24 hours for sales to call them back.
6.  Leave money on the table and walk away if Mavenoid is not right for a prospect
7.  Keep helping your customers after the deal closes to dramatically increase the odds that they refer you to other potential customers.

## Job requirements

1.  You have 3+ years in a full-cycle sales role, ideally at a SaaS startup
2.  You know how to sell at the $50k-$100k price point, and can flex above that
3.  You’ve consistently overachieved against sales targets at past companies
4.  You have experience building your own pipeline from scratch
5.  You’re quick to learn, hardworking, candid, and selfless (table stakes at Mavenoid)
6.  You’re honest, open, and direct in speech and writing
7.  You possess grit and don’t shy away from rejection. Sometimes you need to keep knocking at a door over and over until someone finally answers. You don't give up.
8.  You know how to effectively manage your time to complete objectives. You get important things done and you have a track record of running complex projects.
9.  You learn quickly and you’re able to map technologies to business processes. You are smart, creative, and think well on your feet.
