## About the role

We’re looking for Mid-Market Account Executives who are excited about driving a consultative sales process with a technically savvy prospective client base.

You have a track record of executing a technical sale in a highly consultative manner with both engineering and business personas.  You have a leadership mindset, and enjoy the challenge of building a customer-first team culture and sales process in the midst of a fast paced, hyper-growth business. 

## What you’ll work on:

*   Own the full sales cycle from lead to close for mid-market companies.
*   Develop account plans for gaining and expanding business, including coordinating resources including sales engineering, legal, and leadership.
*   Develop trust and relationships with executive and technical stakeholders.
*   Develop and negotiate complex proposals and contracts.
*   Drive team projects to further develop and refine our sales process and go-to-market strategy
*   Deliver voice-of-customer feedback to our teammates, including our product and engineering teams who craft their road maps directly from customer feedback. 

## We are looking for someone who:

*   3+ years of mid-market sales experience, ideally with a highly technical cloud service
*   Experience selling products with ASP >= $50K-$150K
*   Intense curiosity to learn about your customer’s businesses, with the ability to surface business pain from highly technical environments
*   Embody a growth mindset that seeks to constantly learn and grow. 
*   Demonstrated ability to work across multiple stakeholders with different priorities.
*   Successful experience writing, speaking, and presenting to stakeholders.
*   Ability to operate in a highly ambiguous and fast-paced environment.
*   You have a strong interest in modern web technologies.
