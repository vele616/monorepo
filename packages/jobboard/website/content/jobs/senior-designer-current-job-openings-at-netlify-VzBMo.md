At Netlify, we’re building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development and currently serve more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide. We’re a diverse group of incredible talented people from all over the world. We’re ~44% woman or non-binary, and are composed of more than a fourth as many nationalities as we are team members.

Last year, we raised $63M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. Among our investors are Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, EQT Ventures as well as the founders of GitHub, Slack, Figma and Yelp. This latest round brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $107M to date.

## The Opportunity

We are seeking a Senior Brand Designer to help support marketing initiatives and needs by producing and overseeing digital and print solutions.

It’s a unique opportunity to establish the visual identity for a company with all of the ingredients to build an exceptional brand—a disruptive product, adored by users, an inclusive and capable team, an appetite to swing big, with buy-in and support from executive leadership.

## What you’ll be doing

*   Proficient across disciplines, with an understanding of skill and execution requirements across visual design, user experience design, art direction, and brand positioning
*   Ability to support growth campaigns and conversion efforts using human-centered design thinking. UX design experience preferred.
*   Experience in branding work (brand development, brand refresh) and campaign development, big and small—from brand campaigns and tentpole ideas to seasonal campaigns and promotions
*   Understanding of how to use consumer attitudes and strategic insights to drive creative thinking
*   Experience with motion design preferred
*   A good communicator with the ability to clearly articulate rationale for design decisions
*   Strong understanding of design systems
*   The ability to work autonomously in a remote work environment
