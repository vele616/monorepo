## Job description

## Who We Are

DockYard is hiring an **HTML/CSS Specialist**. We are a 100% remote digital product consultancy. Our in-house team of product strategists, product designers, and software engineers specialize in delivering web applications with a user-driven approach and mindset. We also provide expert HTML/CSS staff augmentation and consulting to help clients build fast, scalable, and reliable products and services.

## What We Do

Our workflow involves three steps. Designers hand off mockups to the HTML/CSS developers who then give styled templates to engineers. Traditionally writing HTML and CSS was the responsibility of designers or engineers, but with the rapid growth of HTML5 and CSS3, we believe that there needs to be a role within the team solely focused on those technologies.

As an HTML & CSS developer at DockYard you will collaborate closely with our in-house Design and Engineering teams to facilitate the handoff between visual design and implementation. In addition to that, you will be challenged with helping drive the creation of web applications and solving interesting problems regarding accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and responsive design.

The ideal candidate is one who lives and breathes HTML & CSS, and continuously seeks to sharpen those skills, stays up to date with modern CSS techniques and emerging web standards, and strives to achieve clean, semantic, accessible markup.

## Responsibilities

*   Own the HTML & CSS development of modern web applications, operating between Design and Engineering teams.
*   Assist in scoping, estimating, and planning for projects, in collaboration with the team lead.
*   Participate in work review, pairing, or other forms of knowledge sharing.

## Job requirements

## Must Haves

*   Proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3
*   Understanding of industry best practices
*   Understanding of BEM methodology
*   Comfortable developing outside of any CSS frameworks (no Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
*   Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
*   Ability to communicate effectively in English.

## Nice to Haves

*   Knowledge of PostCSS and SMACSS
*   Familiarity with a11y practices
*   Experience with Sketch and Git preferred
*   Prior client services, consulting, or freelancing experience
*   Experience working in a remote team
