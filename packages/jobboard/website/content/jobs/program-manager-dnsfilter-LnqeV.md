Program Manager:

DNSFilter was born out of necessity. Our founders realized that the existing solutions for DNS security out there were clunky, convoluted and over priced. In 2015, they set out on a simple yet crucial mission—to revolutionize DNS security. We’ve come a long way since our humble beginnings. We support nearly 14,000 organizations, including Fortune 500 customers like NVIDIA, and provide service to millions of end users. Our infrastructure is made up of two anycast networks with over 300 servers in 53 datacenters. At the start of 2020, our software was processing 1B queries/day. One year later, we’re now processing 12B queries/day! In the middle of a global pandemic, our team (and product) thrived. We doubled the size of our team, and we’re looking to do it all over again in 2021.

To help realize our product vision and sustain our growth, we are looking for an experienced Program Manager that will take the lead on new product feature delivery, tracking product release status, monitoring development team performance, managing our beta program, and maintaining the current status of our development pipeline.
