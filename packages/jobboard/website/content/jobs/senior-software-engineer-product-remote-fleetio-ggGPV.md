We recently raised a $21M Series B round and are on an exciting trajectory as a company. You can learn more about it [here](https://bhamnow.com/2020/11/10/birmingham-based-company-fleetio-raises-21-million-in-funding/).

## About the role

We are looking for a product-minded, team-oriented software engineer with a passion and experience in solving business problems with good design, delightful UX, and scalable architecture.

_**This is a remote role and is open to candidates based in the United States, Canada, or Mexico**._

## What you'll be doing

You’ll work closely with Product Managers, Designers, and other engineers to plan, design, and implement features in the core areas of our platform. You will collaboratively design and architect features, refactor as necessary and write elegant and performant code. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so senior-level experience is key.

## What's in it for you

*   Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company. You will build software used by people all around the world. So many different types of companies and organizations operate a fleet each day, and Fleetio is a good fit for most of them (it’s a huge market).
*   Work remotely (within the United States, Canada or Mexico), or at our Birmingham, AL HQ. Over 80% of our Engineering Team works remotely (including our CTO), and we have promoted a strong remote working culture since the beginning (2012). #LI-REMOTE
*   We place great emphasis on work/life balance. We have families and hobbies and know you do, too.

## Our team

Our Engineering and Product teams are structured as autonomous squads that execute within one focal area toward a defined product vision. We're hardcore believers in easy-to-use software and our main goal as Product Engineers is to quickly and continuously deliver meaningful value to our customers. We've optimized our CI/CD tools and processes to get code into our production environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.
