We are Able, a company building products through a portfolio model, and we are looking for a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer.Do you enjoy the thrill of building complex full-stack solutions with ever-evolving interfaces? Would you like to create products for several industries, following our thesis of impacting the world to make it a better place for all?Able may be the place you’ve been longing for. The one where creative and innovative projects meet with **good-willing and passionate** teams — plus many other perks to boot that we can offer.

## Who are we looking for?

We are seeking someone that feels comfortable using Ruby and Rails, as well as JavaScript (and perhaps Typescript). Specifically, someone who’d be interested in:

*   **Building server-side applications** (as well as RESTful APIs) using Ruby and Rails
*   **Developing client-side applications** mixing React and Redux, and a dash of HTML5 and CSS3.
*   **Employing testing practices** to guide their code-design decisions and ensure product health through E2E suites.
*   Ensuring any application they build is **secure, robust, scalable, and maintainable**.

We want to work with the kind of people who have a passion for collaborating while solving problems, challenging, and nurturing relationships with their teams. The kind that is open about their shortcomings and what they do not know now, and remains eager to do whatever they need to close those gaps.

Ideally, they would also have:

*   About 6+ years of professional experience working as a software engineer (or equivalent, we are flexible)
*   Thorough and up-to-date knowledge of our stack (as stated, Ruby, Rails, JS, and React with Redux).
*   A fair understanding of MVC architectures, as well as how to use databases and data stores such as PostgreSQL and Redis.
*   Good HTML and CSS skills for them to collaborate with designers to transform prototypes into products
*   Experience building modern, responsive and interactive web applications with frameworks such as React
*   Professional proficiency in written and spoken English

Don’t think you are quite there? That’s fine too. Let’s talk and get to know you and your talents!
