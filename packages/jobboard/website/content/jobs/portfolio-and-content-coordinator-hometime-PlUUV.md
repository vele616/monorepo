Hometime is the largest and fastest growing platform for flexible rental providers in the APAC region.

We partner with local hosting businesses and empower them with industry leading technology, supporting infrastructure and scale normally reserved for large companies. Our unique business model means that our local Partners’ success is our success, which we strive for across all teams on a daily basis.

We currently operate throughout Australia and New Zealand, and our team is growing fast as we consistently add new markets.

## About the role

## Day to day you’ll be:

*   Managing Hometime’s property onboarding (and offboarding) pipeline, ensuring timely listing creation to standards 
*   Monitoring external contractor’s copywriting and photography quality, while making changes and recommendations wherever necessary 
*   Supporting and implementing listing content & quality enhancement programs to ensure Hometime Partners’ listings are set up for maximum success on all channels (Airbnb, Booking etc.)
*   Assessing, editing, and creating listing or marketing content as required
*   Responding to Partner queries and providing supplementary support as required
*   Identifying the need for and helping to create value-adding Partner materials
*   Liaising with our external Partners such as Airbnb to quickly resolve potential issues

## Your impact:

This means you’ll be actively contributing to our mission to empower a global network of micro-entrepreneurs to build successful hosting businesses, by contributing to the processes, features, and standards for a seamless property onboarding experience; setting up and monitoring listings for ongoing multi-channel marketing success.

## About you:

We value transferable skills and strengths over experience. We’re looking for someone who ticks off most of the boxes below, but we don’t mind where you developed these skills. This role could be performed remotely from anywhere as long as you have a good internet connection and are able to work ~ 70% overlap during Australian business hours.

## Your skills:

Marketing: Utilising your proven experience in content production and copywriting, you’ll know how to sell a product by highlighting its best features and conveying this to customers to achieve maximum conversion.

Content writing: You’re proficient in creative and persuasive writing in English. You can create content from scratch, as well as analyse the need to edit existing content. 

Customer service: You have excellent verbal, written and people communication skills and are naturally motivated to provide timely, attentive, and upbeat service to Hometime Partners, making sure their needs are met in a manner that reflects positively on the business. 

Project management: You’re able to assist and independently take the lead on identifying and validating problems, before developing and executing solutions.
