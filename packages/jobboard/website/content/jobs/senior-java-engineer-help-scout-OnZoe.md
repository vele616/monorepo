As a member of our Communications team building APIs in Kotlin and Java, you’ll be creating the foundations upon which our Beacon and Messages products are built. These products empower over 11,000 companies around the world to deliver world class support to their customers.

The ideal engineer for this position enjoys building and collaborating on elegant solutions. You relish the opportunity to tackle both customer and product orientated problems. 

## Currently at Help Scout

*   We develop in **Java**, **Kotlin**, JavaScript and PHP
*   We leverage AWS, Redis, RabbitMQ, Aurora MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
*   We also use Slack, Jira, Github, Jenkins, Docker, Drone

## About the role

*   You will be working as a member of a small cross-functional team, responsible for expanding our APIs to support our Beacon and Messages products. These APIs serve tens of millions of requests per day. You’ll be working alongside another JVM Engineer, as well as JavaScript and PHP Engineers, and a product manager and designer.
*   The engineering team is made up of 50 people spread across several small, cross-functional teams.  These teams contain all the back-end and front-end talent to deliver exciting new capabilities.
*   On a daily basis, you'll work on new functionality, and be involved in the decisions made regarding implementation, testing, and backlog prioritization. You will collaborate with the rest of the engineering team through code reviews and participate in making architectural decisions.
*   We work using an iterative software approach, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to remote, agile development. 
*   You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.
*   Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.
*   Everything is secondary to the customer experience. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.
*   You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.
*   In order to ensure enough team overlap, you're located anywhere between Mountain Time and Central European Time zones.

## About you:

*   You became an engineer because you like writing software that helps people.
*   You bring a level of Java-specific expertise that will help us deliver an outstanding experience for customers and fellow developers.
*   You have experience collaborating with other engineers, product, and design folks to craft relevant, customer-focused solutions, that serve high volumes of traffic.
*   You are excited about the JVM ecosystem.
*   You are a skilled, passionate, and humble engineer who is friendly, collaborative, and supportive. You want to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say,“I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.
*   You value personal growth and constructive feedback. Believing that“a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team.  
*   You demonstrate an empathetic, organized and collaborative communication style with fellow engineers and non-engineering stakeholders. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours. 
*   You will consider how your work impacts others, and demonstrate thoughtful, flexible approaches to mentoring and guiding technical decisions.
*   Your code is not only a pleasure for customers to use, but for other engineers to read and understand easily. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.
*   You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea.  You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.

About Us

[Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/) is made by roughly 110 people in 80+ cities around the world, all with a passion for helping others. We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences. Help Scout launched in 2011 and today we have more than 10,000 paying customers in 140+ countries.

Why Help Scout?

**We're remote.** It doesn’t matter if you’ve worked remotely before — we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and are [helping to write the playbook](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remote-culture/) — we’re happy to show you the ropes. Most folks that get a taste of working in a "remote first" company have a hard time going back to the old way of doing things.

**We’re passionate about diversity and inclusion.** The data is abundantly clear about diverse teams being more successful, and we're dedicated to setting the team up for success. Today our leadership team is 62% women, and that's just the start. Here's our [DEI Dashboard](https://www.helpscout.com/dei/) where you can see all of our team demographic data and read about our commitment to this work.

**We're committed to SMBs for the long term.** Help Scout is focused entirely on serving small and midsize businesses, typically up to 500 employees, because those companies view customer service differently. It's not a cost to be optimized, it's their most effective marketing tool and a key differentiator from the competition. We built Help Scout for companies that truly _value_ being customer-centric (like us) and want a product that shares their values.

**We're leaving the world better than we found it.** Did you know Help Scout is a certified B Corporation, with a mission to give away at least 1% of our product through [Help Scout for Good](https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/)? Our company exists not just to help ourselves, but to invest in our team, our customers, our community, and our environment.

Our commitment to you

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates [diversity and inclusion](https://www.helpscout.com/blog/diversity-inclusion-2019/). We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We have read the studies and understand that diverse teams build better products, bring more perspective to the table, contribute to a company’s financial success and help foster a more inclusive environment for all employees, but the bottom line is that it's the right thing to do.
