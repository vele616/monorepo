We started 11Sigma in 2018 with a vision of a world of opportunities and the freedom enabled by remote work.

We believe that remote work is a lifestyle, it’s about the culture, values, and mindset, not a “corporate benefit” or a “post-COVID reality”.

Our three values: explore, be free, and contribute define who we are, and what we do.

Our dream is to build a company open to everyone, which supports you in experiencing an exciting, fulfilling life.

11Sigma is about exploring. Both literal, as in a journey, as well as open-mindedness, self-growth, and curiosity of life and at work.

We are software engineers, travelers, digital nomads, caring parents, adventurers. We are internally-motivated problem solvers and contributors.

To us, life is an adventure, and the world is incredibly interesting. We are hungry to learn new things and explore our potential.

To find exciting work and open amazing opportunities we partner with tech startups that build incredible products and provide a healthy work-life balance.

If the above resonates with you, please read on.


## Job Description

You will join the [11Sigma](https://11sigma.com/) crew at [Briza](http://briza.com), our partner, series-A startup from Canada, recently raised $8M and is growing rapidly. You'll be working with 11Sigma and Briza engineers on creating a one-stop-shop product integrating multiple insurance carriers into a hustle-free service.

The challenge is to find effective ways to integrate APIs from insurance companies that often use slightly different language to describe similar things. That means the job requires excellent technical, analytical, and English skills. You will need to quickly understand domain-specific language and apply your knowledge to integrate new carriers as well as suggest and lead ways to optimize the process. As you may imagine, we are technically solving a complex classification problem in an industry that is waiting to be disrupted.

The product we are working on is revolutionizing the insurance market allowing brokers to get insurance offers from multiple carriers and purchase them directly through Briza app. We deliver value to small business owners that can finally get insurance tailored to their needs in a matter of minutes, not weeks!

Besides our web app, we also provide a developer API.
