## Job Description

You will join the [11Sigma](https://11sigma.com/) crew at [Briza](http://briza.com), our partner, series-A startup from Canada, recently raised $8M and is growing rapidly. You'll be working with 11Sigma and Briza engineers on creating a one-stop-shop product integrating multiple insurance carriers into a hustle-free service.

The challenge is to find effective ways to integrate APIs from insurance companies that often use slightly different language to describe similar things. That means the job requires excellent technical, analytical, and English skills. You will need to quickly understand domain-specific language and apply your knowledge to integrate new carriers as well as suggest and lead ways to optimize the process. As you may imagine, we are technically solving a complex classification problem in an industry that is waiting to be disrupted.

The product we are working on is revolutionizing the insurance market allowing brokers to get insurance offers from multiple carriers and purchase them directly through Briza app. We deliver value to small business owners that can finally get insurance tailored to their needs in a matter of minutes, not weeks!

Besides our web app, we also provide a developer API.
