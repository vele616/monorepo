This is an exciting and challenging role on the Ockam Team. Ockam is building open source, end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated messaging libraries and infrastructure that is designed for the high throughput, low latency, intermittent connectivity requirements of IoT and connected machines.

We're using Elixir to design the core of our messaging infrastructure - Ockam Hub. In this role, you will be responsible for building core components of our Elixir code base. We also use Elixir as our bridge to several enterprise systems and this role will involve building integrations with several external messaging systems and cloud services. Moreover you will be building infrastructure templates and standing up resources in public cloud environments. 

We're using Rust to implement the cryptographic primitives in Ockam and our Elixir library uses our Rust library via Erlang NIFs. Designing efficient, fault tolerant NIFs will be interesting challenge in this role. Cryptographic protocols are utilized throughout the Ockam stack, so whether this is an area of experience or experimentation in your past, you will be challenged.

Ockam is a small and extremely senior team. This role involves architecture, interface design, writing code, responsibility for testing, and publishing documentation.
