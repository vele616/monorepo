As a member of our Merchant Experience team, you will play a vital role in communicating directly with our eCommerce merchants to help them get the most out of Smile and grow their business!

As an Experience Manager, you will be working to support thousands of merchants who have launched loyalty programs with Smile. This role is high-volume, 1:many.

*   Support and delight our merchants through chat, email, phone, and Zoom video conferencing conversations
*   Collect and share churn reasons and product feedback for merchants who have been running Smile for at least 6m through our internal tracking systems
*   Proactively reach out to merchants as per playbooks
*   Assist with any support or implementation overflow work
*   Engage and collaborate with a remote team spread across the world

## Requirements

**What we are looking for:**

*   You have past experience as a Customer Success Manager at a SaaS company
*   You have the ability to creatively problem-solve and improvise in ambiguous situations
*   You can context switch, delving into varying degrees of complexity in requests over the course of a day
*   You are analytical and know your way around Excel and/or BI tools
*   You have excellent written and verbal communication skills
*   You have an insatiable curiosity

**Bonus points if you:**

*   Have eCommerce experience either via your own venture or through past roles
*   Have experience in 1:many, high-volume digital environments
*   Have a basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs)
*   Have experience using Intercom

## Benefits

About the team at Smile!

*   Join a smart, fun and growing Canadian company, with staff located in several countries around the world.
*   Work on a product that tens of millions of people use each month!

## Sound Exciting?

Great! We'd love to hear from you. We aren't looking for just anyone to join our team, so our application process is not going to be your run of the mill application. We would love to see a cover letter that shows us your personality! ... and lets forgo your resume and just send us a link to your LinkedIn profile or other online resume. If you don't have a LinkedIn profile, just make sure that your cover letter addresses the requirements listed above and touches on relevant past experiences.
