**Parade is a self-expression brand.**¬†We make Creative Basics‚Äîunderwear that celebrates who you are today. We believe that women‚Äôs underwear is a replenishment category that needs a mass-market challenger brand focused on delivering style and fabric innovation. Our DNA is community-first and catalyzed via mobile experiences because we know it‚Äôs the best way to find her. Parade has been honored by the Webby Awards and featured in [InStyle](https://www.instyle.com/fashion/parade-underwear-review), [Nylon](https://www.nylon.com/parade-underwear-brand-founder), [Teen Vogue.](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/parade-underwear-thongs-review) [Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9351825/parade-game-time-size-inclusive-underwear-collection), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/virgietovar/2019/11/19/new-underwear-brand-parade-offers-extended-sizing--sustainable-fabrics-for-9/#2a9abdb7192c) and other publications. Parade has raised more than $6M to date from top investors such as Greycroft and Lerer Hippeau, and the founders of Warby Parker, Casper, Bonobos, and Away. In our first full year, we're on track to do $10M in revenue and sell over 750K pairs of underwear!

**We are looking for a junior to mid level designer to develop the evergreen parade brand through growth creative, collateral, and our end-to-end onsite experience. As Parade enters its next phase of growth, we are looking for a technically skilled designer and adaptable storyteller who can assist in the execution and optimization of our digital experience and marketing channels.**

## What You'll Do

*   Overall Focus: Refine our definition of the Parade brand ethos, balancing the aspirational and relatable characteristics of the brand, and helping us understand how this trickles down into every brand touchpoint.

You will not be the executor of copy on email, social, etc--but you will suggest direction.
