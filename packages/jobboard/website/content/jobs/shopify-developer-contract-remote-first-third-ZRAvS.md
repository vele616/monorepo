## Overview Of Role: 

First and Third is looking for a Shopify developer to join us in solving unique problems for our eCommerce clients. Currently, we service quite a few Shopify Plus clients who utilize much of the standard Shopify ecosystem as well as leveraging some of the more popular apps such as Recharge payments, Yotpo, Klaviyo, Klarna and more.

We are looking for a developer to come alongside our team and assist with building and adding features to new themes, implement and build upon Shopify apps, manage and implement custom discount solutions, develop custom reporting solutions, and much more.

## Our mission:

At First + Third, it is our mission to outperform average agencies. We believe that when an agency only thinks about how to get a project done and not enough about the client’s goals, it becomes impossible for the project to be a success.

As an organization we are obsessed with helping our clients understand and achieve their objectives through thoughtful, well-executed web design and development. We are relentless in our pursuit of the very best solution for each individual client and work tirelessly until the desired results are achieved.

As a team, we invest ourselves fully in meeting our client’s goals as if they were our own because when they succeed, we do too.

*   **Make it Engaging -** Be able to work within the Shopify theme to provide an engaging and interesting eCommerce experience that will provide a high level of ROI to the client utilizing Shopify and industry best practices.
*   **Connected -** Be able to work with the Shopify theme API as well as the Front End shopify cart api logic for a truly custom user experience.
*   **Manage -** Be able to manage and implement Shopify features including content, product creation, content and page management as well as utilizing the API for custom features and custom reporting tasks.

Requirements
