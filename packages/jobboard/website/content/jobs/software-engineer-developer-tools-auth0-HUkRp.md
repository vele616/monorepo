Our team is spread across more than 35 countries and we are proud to continually be recognized as a [great place to work](https://auth0.com/press/awards). Culture is critical to us, and we are transparent about our [vision and principles](https://auth0.com/blog/rethinking-your-workforce-strategy-a-look-at-culture-in-2021/). We practice N+1>N which applies to everything from our people to how we iterate our tech; we believe in one team, one score; and we give a shit about everything we do.

Research shows that candidates from underrepresented backgrounds often don’t apply unless they meet all the job criteria. We aren’t looking for someone who ticks every single box on a page; we’re looking for lifelong learners and people who can make us better with their unique experiences. If you think you’d be a great fit, then please get in touch to tell us about yourself.
