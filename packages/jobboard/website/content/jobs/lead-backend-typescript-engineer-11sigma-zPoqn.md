All startups in our network are pre-screened by us for great culture, amazing products, and growth possibilities.

We are driven by the vision of a world of fair opportunities and the freedom of choice enabled by remote work.

11Sigma is about exploring. Both literal, as in a journey, as well as an openness, growth mindset, and curiosity of life and at work. We believe that remote work is a lifestyle, it’s about the culture, values, and mindset.

## Job Description

Currently, we are looking for a new team member to join our [11Sigma](https://11sigma.com/) crew at [Briza](http://briza.com) (our partner). Briza is a series-A insurtech startup originating from Canada. They have recently raised $8M and are growing rapidly. You'll be working with 11Sigma and Briza engineers on creating a one-stop-shop product integrating multiple insurance carriers into a hustle-free service.

The challenge is to find effective ways to integrate APIs from insurance companies that often use slightly different language to describe similar things. You will need to quickly understand domain-specific language and apply your knowledge to integrate new carriers as well as suggest and lead ways to optimize the process.

The product we are working on is like “Stripe for insurance”. It’s revolutionizing the market allowing brokers to get insurance offers from multiple carriers and purchase them directly through the Briza app. We deliver value to small business owners that can finally get insurance tailored to their needs in a matter of minutes, not weeks!

We are looking for an honest, team-oriented, and ambitious person, with a clear sense of ownership. An ideal candidate can communicate clearly in a remote-first environment and is capable of driving innovation at a fast-growth startup.
