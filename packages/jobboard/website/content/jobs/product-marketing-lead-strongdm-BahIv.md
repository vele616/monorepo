**strongDM is a customer-first, second, and third company with a rabid fan base. When was the last time you heard things like:**

_\* Splunk's CISO Joel Fulton says "strongDM gives you what you can’t get any other way -- the ability to see what happens, replay and analyze incidents."_

[They can trust us:](https://www.strongdm.com/blog) we built a technical product for technical buyers. We do not use jargon. There is no alternative but to always be technically accurate. We are not afraid to admit product gaps.  

[We’re real humans](https://www.strongdm.com/about): we built a serious product without taking ourselves too seriously. Each member of the team is deadly good at their job, and yet we crack jokes on the phone with customers.

You set the overall market messaging and quarterly themes with which strongDM goes to market.

You are experienced working directly with product teams to bring new capabilities and product value to market for both internal audiences (sales, SEs, demand gen, writers) and external audiences (prospects, customers, analysts).
