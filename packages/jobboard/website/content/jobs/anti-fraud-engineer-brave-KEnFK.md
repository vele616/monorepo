*   Experience with SQL, Postgres/Redshift, and building analytics queries
*   Experience building robust API endpoints
*   Experience stopping bad actors in a system, e.g. ad fraud, e-commerce fraud
*   A working understanding of fraud vectors, both small scale (client side hacks) and large scale (botnets)
*   Experience with software development via distributed development teams
*   Comfort working in an open source setting
*   A passion for helping protect users’ privacy and security
*   Written and verbal communication skills in English
*   Proven record of getting things done

## Bonus Points
