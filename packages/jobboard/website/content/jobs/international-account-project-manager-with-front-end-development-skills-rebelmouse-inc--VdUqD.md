## Job description

## Who We Are

RebelMouse is a company with a culture built to empower technical people who are have a passion for working outside the box. We encourage curious people to learn UX, design, strategy and understand how the internet truly works. How do you win in Google and Facebook? How do you get people to come back to websites you built? How do you get writers to love the CMS they log in to? These are the questions we work on answering every day and are proud to move the needle for our clients and partners on. We believe in creative developers who have product ideas and love understanding the business and problems, not just having solutions handed to them. We have massive scale as a platform and we have full access to the data behind that. In the last 30 days we reached over 90 million people and over 500 million page views. We understand the changes in Google and Facebook’s algos in a way no other company can.

We are an entirely distributed team. Our bar for geography is none. But our bar for talent is very high. We work in sprints with coordinated team efforts. We use JIRA and support each other in all tasks.

Diversity matters a lot to RebelMouse. Our founder and CEO is openly transgender, most of us are parents, women and 30% of us are LGBTQ+. We are a very safe, positive, and warm environment. We don’t shout at each other. We value laughter and our number one KPI is personal happiness. When your work makes you happy, you make it work. We believe in a very healthy work/life balance that limits the hours spent on screens and in work mode. We encourage our team members to do the daily habits that make them happy - whether its yoga or running or picking up your kids from school. We also encourage our team members to take at least 1 week of vacation time every 3 months.

Considering our rapidly growing business and the fast pace of the media industry, we're expanding our team to ensure our clients and prospects are getting first in class services.

This is why we are opening up a position of client facing frontend developer.
