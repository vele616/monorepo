## ENGINEERING MANAGER

## Summary

We are seeking experienced engineering managers to lead several teams in the Wikimedia Product Department.  These roles are full-time, 100% remote, and global.

We are seeking emotionally intelligent engineering managers who are able to craft a fulfilling work environment for each engineer.  We expect our managers to be proactive and collaborative partners with product, design, and other functions to lead effective teams where everyone is empowered to do their best work. We believe that a human-centered leadership approach is key to a high performing team, and that these two go hand-in hand.

As part of the highly distributed, worldwide, and diverse organization, you will collaborate with other teams through an environment of remote work and asynchronous communication. You will build strong working relationships with peers across functions, and help set context for team members with an eye towards the future.  As a member of our team, you'll always be challenged to solve unique and interesting problems that have real impact on how the world shares knowledge.

We use open source tools as much as possible, and always open source our own work ([check out our documentation](https://doc.wikimedia.org/)). PHP and JavaScript make up most of our code, but we value using the right tool for the job. 

Our world is vast and can be complicated, so we value communication, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn as much as certificates or degrees. 

We’re currently hiring engineering managers for the following teams:

Community Technology: Community Tech is a Wikimedia Foundation team running the Community Wishlist Survey. It builds and improves curation and moderation tools for experienced users, supports bot operators, and more. The team works closely with editors, volunteer developers, and other Wikimedia teams. Editing: The Editing Team works to ensure new and experienced volunteers working in 300+ languages have the tools they need to keep Wikipedia accurate and up to date. The team's main area of focus is a rich-text editor for Mediawiki that enables people to edit Wikipedia's content and communicate with other volunteers without needing to know about or interact with the wiki's markup language. While most of our schedule needs are flexible, we need a manager for this team that will be routinely available between 1pm - 3pm and 6pm - 7pm UTC. Growth: The Growth team works to help new people start editing Wikipedia by introducing new editing workflows that are a fit for more people on more devices. We build a cohesive experience for newcomers, helping them find a place in our communities, connect with others, and start contributing their knowledge.  While most of our schedule needs are flexible, we need a manager for this team that will be routinely available between 1pm - 3pm and 6pm - 9pm UTC. Trust & Safety (T&S): The T&S Engineering Team is a new, interdisciplinary product team developing tools that help our T&S staff and the volunteer admins they work with to enforce policy, procedure, and laws across our projects and communities. This includes some light data analysis tools and some enforcement tools.

## Responsibilities

*   Model empathetic leadership and develop a supportive team environment rooted in psychological safety while ensuring that diverse voices are represented
*   Work closely with cross-functional product, design, community and other peers on the team to deliver high-quality software

## Requirements

## Nice to Haves_In addition to the basic skills needed for being successful, these skills would be very valuable_

*   Experience with MediaWiki development or as a contributor to Wikimedia projects

We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive. The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable, not-for-profit organization that relies on donations. We receive financial support from millions of individuals around the world, with an average donation of about $15. We also receive donations through institutional grants and gifts.
