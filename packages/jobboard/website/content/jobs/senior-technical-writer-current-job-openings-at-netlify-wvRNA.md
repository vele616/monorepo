## Company Overview

At Netlify, we’re building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development. Netlify currently serves more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide.

Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world. We’re ~44% woman or non-binary, and are composed of more than a fourth as many nationalities as we are team members.

We recently raised $63M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. Among our investors are Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, EQT Ventures as well as the founders of GitHub, Slack, Figma and Yelp. This latest round brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $107M to date.

## About the team:

Netlify is built and maintained by a growing group of about 120 cross-functional contributors. We're at a key time in our evolution, building our Documentation team to support an increasing rate of product additions and enhancements across our platform development teams. We're looking for a development-savvy senior technical writer to help write and review documentation and craft UI copy. The Docs team is a small, supportive group whose members work together closely to strive for clarity, consistency, and accuracy across the entire customer experience.

We're hoping our next hire will not just expand the Docs team's bandwidth for documenting new product features and improving existing content but also establish their own focus area over time. We're eager to meet people who are interested in increasing the impact and reach of the team by following their passions and drawing on their particular experience. For example, we could imagine our new senior technical writer establishing data analysis and reporting to help shape the docs roadmap / measure success or working closely with our external partners on mutually beneficial documentation projects.

At Netlify, we aim to create a company culture of empowerment where the best idea can come from anywhere. We believe that empowered and engaged team members do the best work. We don’t want you to work too hard (burnout is real), but we also want to encourage you to grow ([impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is also real) - and we’ll help you do that!

## Who you are:

*   A curious, life-long learner
*   A kind-hearted collaborator who balances an informed viewpoint with humbleness
*   Enthusiastic about identifying problems or opportunities for improvement but equally eager to propose solutions
*   Someone who enjoys getting things done
*   Familiar with web technologies but willing to quickly research and describe something that may be in an unfamiliar domain

## What you'll bring:

*   Clear, consistent, and correct writing in English
*   Ability to review the writing of others with empathy, attention to detail, and a focus on clear content organization
*   Desire to work within established processes and help make iterative improvements to them
*   Foundational understanding of web development technologies. For example, can follow a tutorial using a JavaScript build tool and give feedback about the clarity of the explanations as well as whether following the steps actually works
*   Experience with Git and docs-as-code workflows
*   Familiarity with API documentation principles and tools preferred but not required
*   Experience using Netlify is a plus but not required

## Within 1 month you'll

*   Learn about the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and dive into the inner workings of our platform.
*   Have 1:1s with some of the people you'll be working closely with and get to know your peers in Docs and across your cross-functional team.
*   Familiarize yourself with our documentation site as well as other external-facing resources for our customers. While you're there, you'll use your expertise as a beginner to provide feedback on the docs experience.
*   Tackle your first issue by committing changes and help perform documentation reviews with the team.
*   Familiarize yourself with our new Docs Style Guide and associated linting tools. Complete a few issues to help align current content with our guidelines.

## Within 3 months you'll

*   Establish strong async communication rhythms with your cross-functional team, practicing transparency and visibility.
*   Gain a more robust understanding of platform features, especially in the assigned product area.
*   Join the Docs team rotation: working with Support to determine common customer pitfalls and updating content to help avoid them, reviewing customer feedback on the docs site and performing appropriate follow-up, and leading team triage meetings.
*   Publish documentation for your first project. You'll work with the Product and Engineering organization throughout the development process to write and revise documentation for new features. In most cases, a developer will write a first draft or brain dump, and a writer will refine the work.
*   Work with the UX design team to refine the use of customer-facing language in Netlify products.
*   Support the Docs team through thoughtful reviews.

## Within 6 months you'll

*   Contribute to our writing style guide and assist with expansion of linting rules.
*   Work within and propose updates to our information architecture to ensure that docs content is discoverable.
*   Iterate on docs team processes and related internal docs to improve collaborative efforts.
*   Address complicated Docs backlog issues with support from SMEs.
*   As a steward of the Netlify knowledge base, impact new product planning by identifying edge cases and interactions with existing products and features.
