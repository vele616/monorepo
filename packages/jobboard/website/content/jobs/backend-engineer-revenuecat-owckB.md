At RevenueCat, we make selling subscriptions in your mobile app easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling subscriptions for more than 10 million mobile subscriptions across thousands of apps. We are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the foundation of mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like WidgetSmith, Buffer, and Fishbrain count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.

Our 25 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei, and we're proud to be a remote-first company. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we love our core values: Always be Shipping, Own it, Be Customer-Obsessed, and Be Balanced.

We’re looking for a Backend Engineer to build new system and features, improve our existing infrastructure, and ultimately help developers make more money. Our backend is written in Python and relies on PostgreSQL at its core. We believe in test-driven development, code review, and collaborative engineering. We value the reliable and shipped over the exotic.

## About You:

*   You have 3+ years of experience working as a backend engineer
*   You have at least some experience with Python, and the desire to learn more
*   You are comfortable with SQL backed systems, bonus points if it's PostgreSQL
*   You are a collaborative builder and like to build systems with other engineers in mind
*   You don't scoff at unglamorous engineering tasks, yaks don't shave themselves
*   You are an excellent written and verbal communicator

## In the first month, you'll:

*   Get up to speed on our architecture and learn the problem domain
*   Implement your first pull request and deploy to our 100's of millions of API consumers
*   Begin reviewing code and add to our engineering culture

## In the first three months, you'll:

*   Implement new features that our customers love with the support of other engineers
*   Learn the basics of incident response, and be on the server on-call rotation
*   Fully grasp how we test, review, and ship code

## In the first six months, you'll:

*   Be very knowledgeable about some of our features, being able to answer other team members questions
*   Have a general understanding of the major components of our system and be able to debug complex issues
*   Know a lot more about API design and scalability

## Within a year, you'll:

*   Be able to spec and architect new features with the assistance from your manager or other engineers
*   Translate any technical spec to code once the scope is defined
*   Improve your Python and PostgreSQL skills
*   Receive a lot of actionable feedback and you will be making steps to grow into a Senior Engineer

## What we offer:

*   $133,000-$150,000 USD salary + competitive equity
*   Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage
*   Open vacation policy
*   Generous stipend for home workspace
*   401k match
