## Job description

**WHO WE ARE**

[DockYard](https://dockyard.com/) is a remote software consultancy that specializes in web applications. We have in-house engineers, designers, developers, and project managers, and we are looking for a Software Quality Assurance Engineer (SQA Engineer) to join our growing team. You’ll work alongside talented individuals on groundbreaking projects for the world’s largest companies.

**WHAT WE DO**

We help ambitious companies transform new ideas into fully deployed web applications. Our clients range from seed-funded and early-stage startups, who depend on us to define and deliver business-critical workflows, to established enterprise companies seeking fresh perspective and deep expertise on new projects.

The ideal candidate is self-driven and passionate about web technologies and industry best practices to monitor, analyze, and test software during development.

**RESPONSIBILITIES**

You will be working closely with DockYard engineers, designers, product owners, and client stakeholders throughout all phases of the software development lifecycle, from planning to delivery. You will bring your own perspective to feature requirement analysis and user workflow review sessions in order to surface gaps in requirements, identify edge cases, align on acceptance criteria, and develop a testing strategy.

While engineers are responsible for writing automated unit and integration tests, you will be responsible for testing the application from a user perspective, ensuring that the product meets functional requirements and quality standards (e.g. usability, performance), across varied browsers and platforms.

## Job requirements

**MUST HAVES**

*   2-5 years of experience in quality assurance and testing for web applications
*   Familiarity with Agile software development methodologies
*   Proven knowledge of software QA methodologies, tools, and processes
*   High attention to detail
*   Excellent analytical skills
*   High initiative and ability to work independently
*   Strong team player

**NICE TO HAVES**

*   Prior client services, consulting, or freelancing experience
*   Experience working in a remote team
