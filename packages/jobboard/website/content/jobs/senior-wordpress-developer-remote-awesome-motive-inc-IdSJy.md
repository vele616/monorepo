As a Senior WordPress at Awesome Motive, you‚Äôll join the WPForms team where you will collaborate with awesome team members and tackle a wide range of responsibilities.

WPForms is the most popular WordPress form builder plugin with over 4+ million users. So your work will have a big impact!

We are looking for an experienced backend developer that is already actively involved with WordPress plugin development. You'll help design new features, write/rewrite code, and tackle complex challenges at scale. You will also regularly conduct code reviews and mentor your peers.

Additionally, this is a leadership position where you will earn the opportunity to lead release cycles and manage a small team of developers. You need be passionate about, and have first hand experience with, project management.

## üí° Interested in applying?

üîç Please read/follow the next steps outlined in "How to Apply" at the bottom of this listing.

Attention to detail is one of our core values! This is your chance to stand out :)

To love this role, here‚Äôs the type of person you are:

*   You‚Äôre a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through from conception to completion. Our developers "own" features/tasks and are responsible for scoping, development, and testing.  
    
*   You're an excellent communicator, fluent in both verbal and written English, who makes sure nothing slips through the cracks. We believe communication is **critical** and there is no such thing as over-communicating.
*   You take pride in the quality and craftsmanship of your work rather than just doing it to get it done - with attention to detail.  
    
*   You love mentoring your peers and helping them "level up" just as much as writing code.
*   You are comfortable giving critical feedback to peers (in a respectful and productive manner) and also don't take feedback given personally.
*   You're happy jumping between front-end and back-end development tasks or tackling tasks that require both.
*   You're happy working on tasks of all sizes - from small bug fixes and enhancements to large features/rewrites.

Responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*   Triaging bugs and enhancements that come into GitHub.  
    
*   Scoping, writing, and testing new product features and addons.  
    
*   Communicating with the team and supporting your peers using chat, audio, and video.
*   Supervising other developers; providing feedback, giving peer reviews (PRs), and managing deadlines.  
    
*   Managing sprints and product releases.

Skills you'll need to succeed in this role:

*   People and project management experience.
*   Professional experience with WordPress **plugin** development, architecture, and standards.
*   Advanced proficiency with PHP and MySQL, including modern PHP practices (OOP, autoloading, namespacing, traits, interfaces, etc).
*   Strong familiarity with JavasScript (vanilla JS, jQuery, ES6, etc).
*   Deep experience with build tools like gulp and webpack and package managers such as Composer and NPM.
*   Experience working with third-party APIs (Eg Stripe, Drip, Zapier, etc).  
    
*   The ability to iterate and ship ideas quickly - done is better than perfect.  
    
*   Ability to keep complex ideas and features _simple_. (Simplicity is a core value!)
*   Previous remote work experience.

What we offerWorking for a fast-growing bootstrapped company is a rare opportunity, one we consider a lifestyle choice rather than a job choice. Our positions are challenging, but also come with amazing advantages and fulfillment to those who earn them. Here‚Äôs what we offer.

*   Competitive Salary.
*   Health, Dental and Vision Insurance benefits for full-time U.S. employees.  
    
*   Work from your home. We‚Äôre spread out all over the world ‚Äì United States, Canada, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Singapore and more.
*   Unlimited PTO after 90 days of employment. We encourage employees to take the time they need for vacation, to stay healthy, and to spend time with friends and family.
*   Paid maternity and paternity leave.
*   We happily provide or reimburse software you‚Äôll need as well as books or courses that promote continued learning.
*   We give you the opportunity to solve challenging and meaningful problems that make a difference.
*   Custom Branded laptop at your five year anniversary.
*   We cover all costs of company travel (including our annual all-company retreat and mini-team meetups).
*   Ability to work with some of the best people in the business through frequent, if not daily, interactions.
*   And in case you were wondering: no politics, no b.s., and no jerks.
