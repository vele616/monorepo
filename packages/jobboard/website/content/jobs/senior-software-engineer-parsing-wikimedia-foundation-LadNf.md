## SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, PARSING

## Summary

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for product software engineers to join our team, reporting to product engineering management. As a [product](https://wikimediafoundation.org/role/staff-contractors/#section-30) software engineer, you will be responsible for software engineering for our product user experiences. In this role, you will work in a mostly-remote environment, where we value teamwork and a consensus-oriented approach. You get to write [open source code](https://github.com/wikimedia) for collaborative experiences supporting over a [half a billion pages accessed per day](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects/reading/total-page-views/normal%7Cbar%7C2-year%7C~total%7Cdaily), and you get to do it at a place that believes we're all more successful when everyone has a good work-life balance.

On the Parsing team, we work to support and evolve all things [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext), the markup language behind Wikipedia. We aim to make wikitext easier to write, faster to parse, and less error-prone for humans. We also strive to support editing and content analysis tools with structured representations (ex: DOM).

## You are responsible for:

*   Improving the Wikipedia product experience by fixing bugs and implementing new functionality in wikitext processing
*   Iterating on the evolution of wikitext to structured semantics through collaboration with product managers, designers, client teams, and other engineers
*   Writing multilingual and accessible JavaScript and PHP
*   Creating and maintaining internet APIs with server scripting languages
*   Instrumenting components to monitor feature and quality characteristics
*   Leveraging caching and persistence technologies

## Skills and experience:

*   Academic or professional work in one or more of the following areas
*   Parsers, interpreters, or compilers
*   Programming language runtimes
*   Projects involving domain specific languages or markup languages
*   Projects demonstrating expert knowledge of the HTML5 or DOM specifications
*   4+ years related professional experience in functional programming or OOP
*   Experience building software components with good performance
*   Focused software engineering: you enjoy writing unit and integration tests, proactively addressing security and code review feedback, and thoughtfully balancing architectural tradeoffs

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   A desire to make meaningful contributions to knowledge equity, free culture, and open access
*   An emphasis on communicating clearly in both synchronous and asynchronous channels
*   The Wikimedia ecosystem is complex, resources are limited, and our guiding principles are ambitious. You should be able to navigate that to solve problems
*   Self motivated with an ability to navigate through ambiguity and bring a project to completion with limited direction

## Additionally, we'd love it if you have this:

*   Familiarity with the HTML5 spec and DOM manipulation
*   Familiarity with Wikipedia / wikitext / markdown editing or content management systems (e.g., MediaWiki, Drupal, WordPress)
*   A history of open source contribution
*   Experience bringing a language feature through a product cycle
*   Experience working with large legacy codebases
*   Bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree in computer science, management information systems, or STEM field (or equivalent certification)
