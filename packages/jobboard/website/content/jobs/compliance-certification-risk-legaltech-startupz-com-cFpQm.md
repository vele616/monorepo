## Job description

**Intro**

We are looking for someone to join our team to help us manage our compliance with regulations, obtaining and managing our certifications relating to security and organizational quality, and managing risk and mitigating that with our insurance partners. Don’t worry, you’ll be trained on the job! Just make sure you have the skills listed under ‘About You’.

You manage and obtain our certifications (ISO27001). This means you, and not an outside service provider, work with the certifications authorities to get the certifications awarded.

*   Risk Management

You monitor our risks in different aspects of the company and work with insurance partners to cover those risks. You monitor contracts to make sure our agreements don’t fall outside the limits of our coverage.

We have an open ‘startup-like’ mentality and want you to contribute to this as much as possible. 

_What else can you expect from us?_

*   Enthusiastic and fun colleagues
*   Startup mentality and possibilities
*   Friday afternoon drinks and/or parties (when COVID allows)
