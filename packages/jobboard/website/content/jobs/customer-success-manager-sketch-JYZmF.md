Do you want to be part of a team that helps >1 million designers create amazing products everyday? We are looking for **Customer Success Managers** to join our team and help build this important function at Sketch.

**About Sketch:**

Sketch is where the best products begin. Over one million designers — from freelancers to some of the largest companies in the world — use Sketch to transform their ideas into incredible products, every day. We’re building a platform to empower designers to share and collaborate on their designs and work better, together.

## In this position:

*   We are seeking professionals who are eager to help others design and build flexible, effective, and efficient design operations
*   You will be proactive and excited to serve as the “face of Sketch” to customers. Your role will involve onboarding customers, evangelizing the Sketch Platform, and managing key accounts.
*   The primary goal is not to sell but rather to build relationships, drive enduring adoption and help customers succeed.

## Responsibilities

*   Onboarding business clients and setting them up for success
*   Driving engagement and adoption among existing customers
*   Monitor entitlements in key accounts and drive successful renewals and expansions
*   Deliver actionable and candid feedback from customers to our design and development teams
*   Efficiently manage a high volume of outbound communications
*   Identify, track, and improve the health status of each of your customers
*   Managing a portfolio of 25-35 business customers

## Requirements

*   Experience working directly with customers, in a support or customer success role
*   You must be passionate about great design
*   A deep sense of empathy, and a commitment to integrity
*   Ability to work remotely as part of a close-knit team
*   Stellar written and verbal English communication skills
*   Previous startup experience
*   While this is a remote position, periodic/infrequent travel may be expected for certain in-person customer meetings (if/as the world returns to some kind of normal, post-Covid).

## Bonus

*   If you're an experienced user of Sketch, that's a clear bonus. However, if not we can teach you!
*   Self-starters who can diagnose inefficiencies and optimize processes to maximize results

**Even if you're not able to tick all of these boxes**, we would still love to hear from you.
