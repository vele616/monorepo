PSD 2 payment SCA authentication implementation across Europe hasn't been an easy topic recently, am I right? But then again, it’s an exciting challenge to: A. adjust our operations and B. to also educate our Product teams on that, Prometheus-style 🔥 (Except for the liver part, or except for creating xenomorphs — whichever reference you prefer 😅)If becoming our manager of day to day operational payments processes and the go-to payments person sounds interesting, bear with us!

Doesn’t “Payments Specialist” sound a bit wide? It does because in our case it is!

We’re still an organisation of ~250 people so you won’t be put in just a Fraud, Chargebacks, or any other box — with us you get to run and own the whole payments space start to finish. Which is quite an interesting one — Pleo's up and running in 6 markets right now so we need to systematise and productise where possible all of the different exceptions to the normal payments flow. And if you need some support in educating yourself in some of these areas, you’ll have it 🙂

The current team is made of a Payments Analyst and a Payments Specialist — and the latter is transitioning into Product Manager (we’re all about that horizontal mobility and supporting pleoers ambitions) so we’re looking for someone to take over their responsibilities and also be involved in growing the Payment Ops further as we scale.

And who’s that “we”?

Hi, We’re Pleo — a fintech startup of Danish origin helping companies to make their employees feel valued. Specifically by simplifying company spending for all involved.We think that work will change to be more autonomous and flexible. Pleo is an app that delegates company spending to all employees with credit cards: use your card (virtual or physical), snap a pic of your receipt, and you're done. We take the pain away from employees having to pay out of pocket, and think that if you're going to trust an employee enough to hire them, you might as well trust them enough to spend company money sensibly.

## What does this role entail:

*   Day-to-day operations to support our engineering & customer success teams: tracking and investigating payments infrastructure issues, resolving card fraud, working through documentation/new rules from Mastercard, Payment Processor, and our other partners
*   Owning and building key external stakeholder relations with key persons in our partner banks and other related service providers
*   Keeping the processes running smoothly: owning internal documentation, monitoring our systems
*   Educating Product teams on the subject matter and helping the teams build payment features
*   Ensuring that all money related alerts are investigated promptly
*   Investigating and managing data to analyse payments performance and trends

## Your colleagues say about you:

*   You can answer any question about payment operations / settlements and messaging
*   Know your way around EMEA payment and card schema infrastructure (CHAPS, SEPA, Mastercard etc)
*   Are fluent in different data formats (JSON, ISO20022, XML)
*   Seem to read ISO20022 documentation during holidays
*   Are easy to work with and a person they would also enjoy having a coffee with (virtual or not).
*   Listen to feedback
*   Care about your peers

## Your mom says that you:

*   Are always curious
*   Always come up with the most efficient route to do your errands.
*   You know way too much about everything.
*   Take on challenges happily.
*   Probably work in an IT bank or something (moms).

## Show me the benefits!

*   Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
*   Flexible working remote options for those onsite (just speak to your team)
*   Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones).
*   Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets)

## And here are some other nice gestures that we do

*   Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices when you're here
*   25 days holidays (annual)
*   Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company
*   Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food, etc)

The reason most of us work at Pleo is that we want to change the workplace of today. We are motivated by companies trusting with us and giving us the autonomy to work in the best way for us - and for the company.

Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in one of our offices with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps.

## Sometimes, we want to show some cool things happening here at Pleo 👇
