Able is a product acceleration studio. Our technology teams consist of exceptional product designers, software engineers, product managers, and all-around company builders. We incubate our own investments and also work with our partners (clients) to improve their odds of success by deploying startup-caliber teams that are capable of addressing every stage of the technology venture lifecycle.

Do you enjoy the thrill of building complex full-stack solutions with ever-evolving interfaces? Do you feel comfortable architecting and building these applications, as well as coordinating with the teams responsible for other layers of the product infrastructure?

**Able may be the right place for you, where we connect creative and challenging projects with a passionate and well-intended team—plus many other perks to boot.**

**We are currently looking for a Python Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to join our team!**

## Who are we looking for?

**We are seeking someone that feels comfortable using Python, as well as VueJS. Specifically, someone who’d be interested in:**

*   **Building server-side applications** (as well as RESTful APIs) using Python.
*   **Developing client-side applications** using VueJS, and a dash of HTML5 and CSS3.
*   **Employing testing practices** to guide their code-design decisions and ensure product health through E2E suites.
*   Ensuring any application they build is **secure, robust, scalable, and maintainable**.

We want to work with the kind of people who have a passion for collaborating while solving problems, challenging, and nurturing relationships with their teams. The kind that is open about their shortcomings and what they do not know now, and remains eager to do whatever they need to close those gaps.

Ideally, they would also have:

*   About 5+ years of professional experience working as a software engineer (or equivalent, we are flexible)
*   Thorough and up-to-date knowledge of **Python** (with frameworks like **Flask**) and **JavaScript** (using libraries like **VueJS**).
*   A fair understanding of MVC architectures, as well as how to use databases and data stores such as PostgreSQL and Redis.
*   Good HTML and CSS skills for them to collaborate with designers to transform prototypes into products
*   Experience building modern, responsive and interactive web applications with frameworks such as VueJS, ReactJS (nice to have)
*   Professional proficiency in written and spoken English
*   **Availability: This position is 100% remote. We are looking for talent who can commit to at least 6 hours of overlap with our main team’s office working hours in Lima-Perú (From 09:00 am to 06:00 pm GMT-5)**

**Don’t think you are quite there? That’s fine too. Let’s talk and get to know you and your talents!**

## Why would you love to work for Able?

We believe that people, teams, and well-thought processes are more important than the ideas themselves, and we’re keen on bringing great people together while investing in their growth.

Our teams have built products in various industries, from media to finance to toys to healthcare. Sometimes we will work with management teams to help their businesses grow faster or unlock value using technology. Other times, we start or buy businesses outright. Each time, though, we will look for opportunities to leverage technology built at the portfolio-level to drive value faster and grow as a group.

And we like to offer great benefits to ensure you have the best experience working with us:

*   We offer competitive base compensation, and the ability to earn an incentive performance-based compensation.
*   We want to improve skills through continuous feedback, training, and practice; keep our teams small to ensure everyone is in a position to make a significant impact; continue challenging all of our team members as they grow
*   We believe in giving back to the community and helping others, which is why give the team social impact hours to use at their discretion
*   We offer flexible paid time off for all full-time employees (including vacation, sick days, and wellness days) because we understand the value of health, relaxation, spending time with friends and family and traveling the world
*   We believe a healthy body equals a healthy mind, so we offer a monthly health and wellness reimbursement

We know that a diverse team brings extraordinary success, and we have created a work environment geared towards work and life balance as well as happiness. Able is committed to inclusion and diversity and is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or veteran status.

## Our Core Values

*   **Champion Outcomes Over Effort**; You take ownership of problems and emphasize that the results created are more important than the time we spend or the approach that we take
*   **Contribute to the Solution**; You are responsible for identifying issues, and doing what you can to help solve them
*   **Put People First**; You emphasize people and relationships over process or ideas. You seek to build and reinforce trust with colleagues and clients 
*   **Commit to Diversity**; You contribute to a world where everyone can be themself, together
*   **Get Better Every Day**; You believe we all have the ability to improve and we're driven to help everyone be the best they can be

This is but the beginning of a conversation we’d love to have with you.

**_Apply, and let’s get this adventure started!_**
