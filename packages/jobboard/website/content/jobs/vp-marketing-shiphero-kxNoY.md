## VP of Marketing

We love marketing, help us get better at it!

ShipHero does over $30MM in ARR, is growing more than 100% YoY, is profitable and is well capitalized. We care about and understand the value of marketing across all levels of the organization. See our youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/shiphe...](https://www.youtube.com/shiphero)to see some of the content we've been putting out. We have a talented group of marketing people on the team, but we don't have a leader who has done SaaS marketing before. Are you the right marketing leader for ShipHero?

Our AVC is $50K with our largest customers spending over $1 million a year with us.

We have two products:

*   a SaaS warehouse manage product for ecommerce brands and 3PLs that serve ecommerce brands
*   an outsourced fulfillment solution which uses the same software but in our buildings with our employees - [https://fulfillment.shiphero.c...](https://fulfillment.shiphero.com/) we call it FaaS

## Responsibilities:

*   Hire, lead and manage our marketing team.
*   Drive a pipeline of leads for our sales team.
*   Define the strategy for SaaS and FaaS including potentially rebranding FaaS with a new name.
*   Work closely with our product team to promote and explain what we do today and new features as they are developed.
*   Work closely with the sales team.
*   Be a strong member of the leadership team.

## Requirements:

*   5 years of SaaS marketing experience, in the ecommerce space is preferred.
*   3 years in a management position leading a staff (5+) of employees.
*   Strong business, communication and presentation skills
*   Organized with the ability to manage & track multiple priorities.
*   Ability to collaborate effectively with others across the organization to accomplish team goals.
*   Track record of working with talented marketers and mentoring less experienced members of the marketing team.
*   Drive to deliver value to clients and to help shape and build a fast-paced, growing organization.

ShipHero is an 8 year old company. We've built the company with a product and engineering focus and a focus on profitability. We care about our customers and helping them succeed. We've been a distributed company since we started and we have team members around the US as well as Argentina, Canada, Spain, New Zealand and more. There is no office.

We have a talented, hard working and loyal team. If you join, you can expect to work hard, but with helpful team mates and lots of down time. We believe aly in asynchronous work. You won't have people slacking you at dinner time unless there is a real and urgent issue tasks and there is a a focus on long form written communication. Think writing a 3 paragraph email about the issue you're trying to solve, not a dozen one sentence slack messages. We believe in asynchronous work because we believe focussed time is important. The team across all levels of the organization is extremely talented and we have very low turn over. You will report to the CEO.
