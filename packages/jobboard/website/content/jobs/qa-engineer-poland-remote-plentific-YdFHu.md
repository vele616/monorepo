**The Role**

**This is a fully remote position based anywhere in Europe.** We currently have a number of remote engineers based in the UK, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and Romania.

We are looking for an experienced QA Engineer to join the engineering team test our functional and non-functional areas of our product solutions using both automation and manual techniques. You’ll be working alongside a highly technical and motivated team and report to the technical co-founder. You would be expected to apply fundamental engineering and mathematical skills to solve problems and overcome challenges, not just develop code. For people with the right mindset, this frame of mind provides an intellectually stimulating environment.

The engineering team sits at the centre of everything we do at Plentific and is constantly tackling challenging problems, such as online payments, quoting, invoicing, booking, search / scoring algorithms, ETL, data pipelines, in-app messaging, real-time notifications and fraud prevention. Our backend engineers mostly work with Python and Django on an increasingly more service-oriented architecture. The tech stack includes Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, JavaScript (ES6, React.js, Alt.js, Node.js, Express), AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Redis, Celery, Pandas, Numpy, Scrapy, Git (with Zenhub), Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Logstash and lots of raw SQL for analytics. We have a very large and clean code base as we put significant emphasis on design patterns, code readability, testability, maintainability and extendability.

**Responsibilities**

*   Ensure the quality of the product end-to-end
*   Work across the engineering teams to ensure everything is clearly defined and tested
*   Own all the testing activities during a project
*   Write bug and test reports with all of the necessary detail
*   Improve, extend and develop our automation test packs in order to reduce manual testing
*   Work closely with Engineers and investigate issues found during testing
*   Configure test environments for both manual and automated tests
*   Work with product owners, product managers, user interface designers and other software engineers to contribute to solutions
*   Ensure all software is reliable, scaleable and quality
*   Contribute towards the future efficiency of the QA team

**Requirements**

*   2+ years QA engineer experience, understanding QA processes and methodologies
*   Python programming experience
*   Passionate about designing test coverage and the creation of automated and manual tests
*   Experience of working with a variety of QA tools
*   Experience with web applications including API testing, database testing, AWS infrastructure
*   Ability to think out of the box with a can-do attitude to get things done efficiently
*   Excellent communication skills with ability to articulate technical concepts in plain English
*   BSc (at least 2:1) essential in computer science, engineering, computational physics, mathematics or another field with strong computational curriculum. MSc/PhD in similar subjects desirable

**Benefits**

As you can see, we have big plans and are eager to grow our team of dreamers and doers to achieve our vision of managing over 1 million properties through our platform across various countries. You can help us shape the future of property management. Here’s what we offer:

*   A competitive compensation package.
*   Flexible working.
*   Learning and development fund.
*   An inherently diverse culture with over 18 nationalities and 21 languages spoken.
