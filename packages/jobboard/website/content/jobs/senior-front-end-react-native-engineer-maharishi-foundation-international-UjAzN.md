Over the past 60 years, more than 10 million people worldwide have learned the TM technique through personal instruction by tens of thousands of certified teachers.

We favor a healthy and balanced work environment with opportunities for personal development.

## Job summary

We are looking for a senior front-end engineer with a proven track record of developing React Native mobile applications. As we are a small but growing team, you will be responsible for the maintenance and support of existing app features as well as planning and scoping new feature additions and iterations.

You will be working closely with our team to launch a meditation and lifestyle application. Applicants should have a proven track record working on large scale, consumer-facing products with complex and intuitive UX/UI. Applicants should be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, where each individual has a lot of influence and responsibility to deliver. You will play a vital role in the development and release of this application. There is an existing global community keenly awaiting the launch of this application, so the app will have an immediate, engaged user base. 

The AWS backend is built using a serverless approach using AppSync (GraphQL), DynamoDB, Cognito and Lambda. Local development and stack deployment is managed using the Serverless framework, and CI pipelines have been implemented using CircleCI and Bitrise. Experience with any of these is a big plus.

## About you

You are passionate about creating beautiful, modern, and intuitive user interfaces on mobile devices. You are comfortable with cross platform development (for iOS and Android), and enjoy solving the challenges that come with such a codebase. You understand API architecture, and can take a data model and translate it into reusable and flexible components. You enjoy shipping clean, readable and reusable code. You are comfortable working on a distributed team spread across timezones and cultures. You are excited to use technology to have a positive impact in the world as a whole, and in an intimate way for each individual.
