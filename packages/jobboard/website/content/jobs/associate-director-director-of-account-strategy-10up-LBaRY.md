Account Strategy Directors are responsible for owning and driving strategic partnerships for a set of diverse, cross-industry client portfolios or a sizable pillar account spanning multiple departments and work streams. Directors work closely with day-to-day Account Strategists and production teams to foster client success and growth through creative thinking and outstanding service.

Leveraging a foundation of experience and expertise in successful digital account and/or project management, primary functions include: establishing and nurturing direct relationships with client partners; working with Account Strategists and project teams to build actionable strategic account plans that align with well understood client partner business goals; validating quality project outcomes in alignment with client expectations and 10up craftsmanship; qualifying and cultivating new opportunities; forecasting account trends and performance; proactive personnel development, performance remediation, and escalation resolution; productively collaborating with other discipline leaders (e.g. back and front end engineering, UX and visual design, ad strategy, and audience growth) and project teams to support expectation management and client satisfaction across projects.

The Associate Director and Director roles are vital as they directly influence the happiness and growth of everything from account management personnel to client success.
