Able is a team of designers and engineers that have started, grown, and sold technology companies. Now we pool our skills as a team to build a growing portfolio of businesses. We believe the future of investing will be driven by technical capability and that people with our skills shouldn't have to bet everything on the success of a single startup.

We are looking for an Engineering Manager to mentor and help build our Lima engineering team. This person would be responsible for shaping it into an excellent form, by establishing sincere relationships with direct reports, supporting their career development needs, and fiercely contributing to the company growth.

## What will be expected of you:

*   Identify team member’s strengths and weaknesses, and nurture their skills to achieve their true potential
*   Communicate company’s vision and strategy to the team and serve as a point of contact for any questions
*   Encourage the team’s drive and empower them to achieve great deeds
*   Exercise your technical skill set by coaching your direct reports in their career paths
*   Help build the structure that will support scaling operations of the Engineering team
*   Support hiring efforts, evangelize about the company and help us build Able’s brand in Lima

## What you contribute:

*   Empathy to care for your team’s needs as well as to advocate the right solutions for the company
*   Superb communication skills that allow you to expose your ideas in a clear way
*   Passion for collaborative problem solving and the willingness to challenge, debate and form relationships with team members
*   You know what you don’t know, you have no problem admitting it, and you’re eager to do whatever it takes to address that gap
*   A desire to improve Able’s product development practices and the experience to follow-through on implementation

## Qualifications:

*   5+ years professional experience as a software engineer or equivalent
*   Previous experience coaching people to help them reach professional opportunities
*   Professional proficiency in written and spoken English

## Why would you love to work for [Able](https://able.co/)?

We believe that people, teams, and well-thought processes are more important than the ideas themselves, and we’re keen on bringing great people together while investing in their growth.Our teams have built products in various industries, from media to finance to toys to healthcare. Sometimes we will work with management teams to help their businesses grow faster or unlock value using technology. Other times, we start or buy businesses outright. Each time, though, we will look for opportunities to leverage technology built at the portfolio-level to drive value faster and grow as a group.And we like to put our money where our mouth is, offering great benefits to ensure you have the best experience working with us:

*   Flexible work hours and locations (work from home included!)
*   Competitive salaries
*   A MacBook to work with
*   Complimentary lunches and snacks when we’re at the office
*   Payroll (with bonuses on July and December, CTS and paid vacations)
*   English classes
*   Health insurance
*   Benefit reimbursements
*   Annual reevaluation of base compensation
*   Annual variable compensation based on individual and company performance
