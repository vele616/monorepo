**Who We Are**

Red Canary was founded to create a world where every organization can make its greatest impact without fear of cyber attack. Our combination of market-defining technology, processes, and expertise are preventing breaches every day. We are completely changing the way security is delivered and setting the new standard for security. If our mission resonates with you, let’s talk!  

**What We Believe In**

\- Do what’s right for the customer

\- Be kind and authentic

\- Deliver great quality

\- Be relentless

**Challenges You Will Solve**

The Short-Term Engagements team extends Red Canary’s charge of making security better for every business to consulting organizations; where we augment our partners’ capabilities using a unique combination of operations, threat research, and engineering to deliver more effective engagements.

Your team is the front line response focused on disrupting cyber adversaries. You’ll be responsible for leading our short-term engagements analysts; working alongside our consulting partners during active breaches to identify and investigate threats in endpoint telemetry. Your involvement in our operations directly impacts our team's success in restoring business function to global organizations. This role has the responsibility of managing, coaching, and mentoring highly technical direct reports and championing operational initiatives that make your team most effective in delivering security answers. Your team is nimble and versatile; ready to take on any engagement that our consulting partners bring our way.

Adversaries are continually evolving and attacking businesses - and your team is the tip of the spear. 

**Who You Are**

You live and breathe threat detection and response. Perhaps you’ve run a SOC team or two, or hung your hat as an incident response manager. You’re intimately familiar with the pain a bad indicator or a false positive storm brings on an operational team, and know how to scale a live response investigation.

Management isn’t suited for everyone, but it’s definitely for you. Working with a highly technical team excites you, and you’re confidently able to provide both investigative coaching and managerial feedback. You take pride in being able to build highly effective teams, using carefully crafted metrics as your guide to operational excellence. Your lever for operational scale has always been automation, and you’re laser focused on letting people tackle novel problems and letting machines handle the rest.

You’re also not afraid to lead a big initiative; managing and creating projects that require involvement across multiple teams is second nature.

Ultimately, you’re passionate about supporting talented analysts and ensuring that together with our consulting partners, we can respond to the most advanced compromises around.
