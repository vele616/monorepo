## The Opportunity

Shorthand is a growing company that provides a digital publishing platform to many of the world’s best known publishers, brands, not-for-profits, and universities. With customers on every continent (except Antarctica!), there’s never been a more exciting time to join Shorthand. Our company has the rare distinction in this era of money-burning startups of being both investor-backed and comfortably profitable.

## The Role

Shorthand is a fully remote workplace with staff across Australia, New Zealand, the USA and more. For this role we are looking for someone based in Australia with exceptional verbal and written communication skills in English.

It is a full-time role however for the right candidate we could work out a part-time option.

You will own and shape the UX research process at Shorthand. While you will report to the Director of Design you will be mostly autonomous.

The role includes a variety of UX activities, including some user testing, with a span focus on research. However, we’re looking to you to define the best approach for each challenge.

## How we work

The Product & Design teams at Shorthand work in 6 week cycles, based on the ‘Shape Up’ process developed by Basecamp ( [https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01) ). We have found this to be a great way to increase momentum, limit risk and distribute responsibility. 

While we already have a good understanding of our users (we hope!), it tends to be fairly distributed across the different parts of the business. You will consolidate that knowledge, validate and build on it, and ensure it is communicated clearly.

## Core Responsibilities:

*   Conduct regular remote research activities with existing Shorthand users across a multitude of timezones.
    
*   Assist in validating and guiding the development of new features.
    
*   Help identify new opportunities for creating features or improving current ones.
    
*   Provide clear, actionable recommendations that are backed by data and/or documented observations.
    
*   Create and maintain span lines of communication across all parts of the business.
    
*   Understand the company goals and be able to balance them with those of the user. 
    
*   Develop, maintain & share relevant documentation such as journey maps, personas and research findings.
    
*   Help create a shared vocabulary that can be used to educate and mentor others.
    

## Qualifications:

*   A minimum of 2 years professional experience with a broad set of research tools.    
    
*   Experience in owning research projects from concept to implementation.
    
*   Demonstrated experience with cross-functional collaboration and communication.
    
*   Understanding of UX qualitative research techniques from discovery research through to concept testing, user testing and analysis of live performance.
    
*   Have developed and conducted research and user testing, ideally remotely.
    
*   Understanding of research in the context of rapid product development.
    

## Compensation and Benefits:

*   Competitive salary.
    
*   Flexible hours.
    
*   Freedom to own and grow the UX research process.
    
*   Opportunity to work in a small, high growth SaaS company where your voice will be heard.
    
*   Fully remote working, with allowance for co-working space if required.
    
*   Allowance for setting up your home office.
    
*   Health and Wellness fund to support a healthy lifestyle.
