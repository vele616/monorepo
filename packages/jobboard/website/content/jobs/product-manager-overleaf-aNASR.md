## Description

## What we do

Overleaf is a social enterprise that builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We have over seven million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.

## Who we are

Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of about forty based mainly in the UK, Europe, the US and Canada. We were recently recognised as one of the [UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses) and as the [Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner) in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program. Our vision is to be the go-to place for writing scientific documents.

## How we work

Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office in Farringdon for those in the London area, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.

We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which our development and product teams have 10–15 minute daily standup calls.

We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run surveys and user interviews on a weekly basis to inform our Product Discovery process.

We have a flexible roadmap that we review quarterly, which includes regular user-facing releases. Our Product team works closely with everyone in the company, from Support, to Finance and Marketing to understand every aspect of how we can best deliver value to our users. Our roadmap also includes initiatives driven by staff and quarterly hackathons to keep our learning fresh.

## About this role

As we expand, we are shaping our product team to better address user needs within specific areas of the product (e.g. onboarding and acquisition, premium features and retention). We are now looking to hire an enthusiastic Product Manager to join one of our new multidisciplinary teams. You will take ownership of researching, understanding and developing a part of our customer journey, shaping up its roadmap and defining how to measure success. You will also lead on projects related to your area of expertise from start to finish.

This will usually involve:

*   Work with our UX team to:
    *   Carry out primary research to understand your users, their pain points and identify opportunities to address them.
    *   Nurture and grow our rich database of user insights, mining data when needed and present it to stakeholders so that they can make informed decisions.
    *   Develop new strategies for regularly monitoring and collecting user feedback.
    *   Based on research insights, formulate hypotheses to be tested with a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods.
*   Once we get to developing solutions, working closely with the development team and other stakeholders to:
    *   Shape a vision, defining the problem and align the team with clear objectives and user stories.
    *   Represent the needs of the user and other stakeholders to the engineering team throughout the process. Be confident in conveying user needs with tangible examples from user research.
    *   Play a lead role in the delivery process from start to finish, working closely with designers and engineering to solve issues that arise as we iterate on releases.
    *   Monitor the impact of new features and releases, to determine if they achieved the goals set out for them at the start.
    *   Be part of planning sessions with your team to help them prioritise and work efficiently.
*   Working closely with internal teams (Sales & Marketing, Support, Business) to:
    *   Clearly communicate our roadmap and product changes in advance of their launch.
    *   Understand and address their needs, including any obstacles they may have in serving customers.
    *   Help them access and understand product information, dependencies and data that they need to do their job well.
    *   Ask for input and insights from their perspective to help us improve our product on an ongoing basis.

This year, we are excited to be working on:

*   Launching a new analytics system and team to generate insights into our B2C funnel and help us understand our users better, while respecting their privacy.
*   Enhancing the collaboration experience on our product to make it even more compelling for individual users and teams.
*   Delivering a new UI to help users troubleshoot their LaTeX compilation errors more effectively and help them publish their work more quickly.
*   Revamping our template gallery to help users find what they need to produce the best documents.

Here is an example of a feature that we launched recently to help users navigate their projects more easily: [https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-file-outline-is-now-available-on-overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-file-outline-is-now-available-on-overleaf)

## Who you are

*   Empathetic. You are curious about people and their stories, you could spend hours talking to customers and stakeholders and never get bored.
*   Data-driven. You base your decisions on observations and data that’s available to you. Whether it’s from a survey, a database or a user interview, you are comfortable reading insights and presenting them to your stakeholders.
*   Self-motivated. You are a natural at making plans, keeping people aligned along the way and thrive when you see a vision come to life.
*   Technical enough. You are not a developer, but you are interested in and/or familiar with the technologies developers work with and the challenges they may encounter.
*   Collaborative. You listen, help and understand others. You are an independent thinker while remaining a great team player.

## Desired, but not required

*   Understanding of UI and UX best practices
*   Understanding of the scholarly market and/or some knowledge of LaTeX
*   Experience of product management frameworks and tools (e.g. JTBD, Story Mapping, etc.)
*   A technical background or experience of working in technical environments

## How We Hire

The stages in our hiring process are typically:

1.  We ask you to submit a CV and a cover letter stating why you would like to work for Overleaf.
2.  We will aim to update you on the status of your application within two weeks from when we receive it.
3.  We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.
4.  We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically followed or combined with a practical assignment. For the practical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or doing an exercise during the interview, if you prefer. The exercises are practical in nature, and you can use Google, etc., and ask us questions.
5.  We may ask you to attend a second, shorter, interview with our Founders.
6.  We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.

If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.

## Requirements

We require that you:

*   Have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience.
*   Will work for us full time (or nearly full time).
*   Will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.
*   Are based in the UK, Europe, US or Canada.

Experience with the technologies we use is always a plus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.

## Benefits

*   Remote and flexible working.
*   Salary £40k–£60k per year depending on experience.
*   You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.
*   We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source.
*   We're backed by [Bethnal Green Ventures](https://bethnalgreenventures.com/) and [Digital Science](https://www.digital-science.com/), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.
*   Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.
*   You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.
*   We provide a training budget; many of our staff choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.
*   We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
