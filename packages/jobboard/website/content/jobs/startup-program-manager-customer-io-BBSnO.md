Hello! My name is Kyle and I head up the Partners Team at [Customer.io](http://customer.io). One of the newer growth strategies of our team has been building the [Customer.io Startup Program](https://customer.io/startup-program/). This program is designed to give funded startups access to Customer.io at a discounted rate so they're able to build a world-class messaging tool into their stack early on.

We've seen this program take on a life of its own, with +1,000 startups applying so far and dozens more applying every day. As the Startup Program manager you will be responsible for maintaining this audience of extremely valuable customers and potential customers while seeking new ways to grow and expand the program to hit key mile stones on a quarterly and annual basis.

## Some things you'll do:

*   Review, approve, deny, and do further inquiry of Startup Program applications
*   Manage relationships with our expanding list of VC partners (verifying applicants, meeting at fixed intervals to explore opportunities to increase exposure, providing Customer.io trainings/demos to portfolio companies)
*   Provide support and guidance through the conversion process to approved applicants
*   Create a community and content plan to provide and extract value from our startup audience
*   Improve upon the experience we've built for startups signup and graduation processes
*   Identify key VC partner relationships as well as highlight and strategize with VC partners who are not providing adequate value
*   Lead high-value startups through our premium renewal process
*   Work continually along side the partner team to grow and expand the program

## About you:

*   Sales and public speaking are something you understand enjoy
*   You’re curious and enjoy learning about different businesses and industries
*   You’ve got a thirst for knowledge, and are keen to understand our app
*   You have an entrepreneurial spirit: You work best when there is less structure and enjoy the process of building something from scratch
*   You enjoy the process of setting challenging goals and creating a plan to hit them

## What we're looking for:

*   A background in SaaS
*   You've worked for, with, or on Startups in some fashion and have an understanding of the VC process
*   Excellent communication skills (verbal, written, presentation), high emotional IQ, and a drive to achieve.
*   Flexibility to adjust your day-to-day to fit with the most critical tasks on hand
*   Personal success stories of building customer facing programs that drove positive ROI
*   Thirst for knowledge, a hunger for continuous learning, and innate curiosity.

All final candidates will be asked to complete an employment and education verification authorization form (which allows us to verify your job history and education listed on your resume) as part of our pre-employment process.

Customer.io recognizes the stifling impact of systemic injustice on diverse communities. We commit to using our influence to increase inclusion and equity within the tech industry.
