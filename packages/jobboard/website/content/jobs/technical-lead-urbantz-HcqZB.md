About Our Stack:

*   We migrated from AWS ECS to Azure using Kubernetes for container-orchestration. Our main data store is MongoDB hosted on Mongo Atlas, but we also use Elasticsearch for some corner-case full-text search needs. Our backend and API code runs on Node.js, while the front-end web application is written in AngularJS and we are looking into migrating it.

*   Our toolset also counts with single-command, build & deploy tasks for both production and staging environments, working along with GitLab CI. We use Protractor for the end-to-end testing and Jest for the back-end unit testing.

*   Have min 6 years of experience as a Software Developer

*   Flexible company, nice colleagues to work with, fun company activities (even for our remote people!),...
