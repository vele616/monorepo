Who are we?

We are Invisible’s Analytics Team. We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen. How?

We Believe That

\-- Invisible is a world-changing company and the Analytics Team is responsible for creating the systems that will launch Invisible into the stratosphere

\-- Exponential gains from systems > Short term linear work > Systems for system's sake

\-- Consistent feedback is key - we are addicted to learning and getting better

\-- What one of us knows, all of us should know

\-- Every new mistake is a learning opportunity

Because of these beliefs, we’ve built a team where

\-- Distributed approaches and centralized intelligence merge. Each teammate is constantly innovating and trying something new. Every mistake is prevented by all. Every success is learned by all.

\-- Each of us contains the sum of the knowledge, intelligence, and creativity of our entire team.

\-- We evolve and mutate constantly like an organism, identifying successful and problematic tactics and incorporating ideas from any source.

Who We Want

\-- Someone who's bias toward proactive communication / 'over-communication' with the manager about the status of projects and tasks
