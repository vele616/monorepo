You are an experienced andaccomplished backend software engineer and you are looking for a new challenge. Somewhere you can actually add value rather than being another cog in the wheel.We have a great engineering team who are looking for someone with your seniority and skillset to help us achieve our goals.

You love data and love working with data on a daily basis. Our products are all based around data, and we are using the latest and greatest tech to change our industry for the better. We are evolving our tech all of the time and you want to be an influence of that. You have strong opinions on what good tech looks like and you want to be heard. We are listening.

Whilst you are experienced and at a senior or principallevel in your current or most recent position, you want to grow and understand that there is no ceiling. You want to give your experience and knowledge to something special and be part of its journey but you also want to grow and develop into a better engineer than you are now.

Our Engineering Leadership teams mission, which we hope you can be a part of, is to have all of our engineers skilled and trained up on both TypeScript and Python. If you are well-versedin both, then fantastic, we want to speak with you! If you are strong in one or the other then, again, you are someone we would like to speak to.

**About us**

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:

*   Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models
