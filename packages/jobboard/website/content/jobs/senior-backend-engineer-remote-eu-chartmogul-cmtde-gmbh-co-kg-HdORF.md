As with many young companies, your responsibilities will change over time. However, here are some of the responsibilities we expect you to take on as a BackendEngineer:

*   Gathering and processing large volumes of data, you'll play a meaningful role in improving a backend that processes very high volumes of raw data.
    
*   Supporting the rest of the team in improving the quality of our main Rails application.
    
*   Contributing to technology strategy – we will decide together how to evolve our data processing pipeline using technologies that fit our purposes.
    
*   Staying up to date with the latest trends in technology.

*   You have experience with Ruby.
*   Good knowledge of cloud environments, particularly AWS and DigitalOcean.
    
*   Good knowledge of the fundamentals of software development – how to structure programs and decompose problems, when to apply patterns, and understand to select the right paradigm for a task.
