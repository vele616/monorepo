*   Proven ability to adhere to deadlines and to seek out learning and support
*   Excellent verbal and written communication skills as well as the ability to clearly communicate technical concepts to non technical stakeholders

## Qualities that are important to us:

*   Strong value and mission fit with the Wikimedia movement and Foundation
*   Comfortable working in a highly collaborative, consensus-oriented environment
*   Ability to work effectively in multiple cultural contexts

## Additionally, we’d love it if you have:

*   Comfortable working in a terminal / command line environment
*   Conceptual understanding of cron or other automated scheduler tools
*   Experience working with noSQL and non-structured data
