## Job description

Plural makes it easier for finance professionals to understand data and find and share new insights. We convert large amounts of data (like spreadsheets) into a single knowledge graph. The primary way that users derive value from our product is by interacting andvisualising their data in new ways, from which they can identify and share insights.Over time we plan this to be a tool that can be used by any knowledge professional working with data.

We foresee two major design challenges:

1.  Ensure that the interface or the UX do not get in the way of our user getting value from our product
2.  Design novel data visualisations that allow our users to see data from different perspectives so they can discover new insights that can be easily shared

Specific challenges for our audience:

*   We're introducing a brand new workflow to users with ingrained work practices
*   We're competing with well-established (if outdated) workflows in products like Excel
*   The UX contains interactions with complex and unfamiliar visualisations such as knowledge graphs, which may not be intuitive to the user to use
*   There's a lot of clever AI work that goes on in the background and we want to ensure our interface gets the most value out of it without adding complication to the workflow

Information visualisations we love:
