Senior UI Engineers have advanced knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as experience building large-scale modular applications. They are experienced in interpreting designs and crafting solid, reusable, and maintainable HTML and CSS for enterprise clients. They effectively consult with Designers on how to design for the web.

In addition to Senior UI Engineers being advanced in the skills of their discipline, they are also effective consultants and collaborators. They know how to balance a client’s needs, budget, and requirements. With knowledge of cutting edge techniques and an understanding of the constraints of scope and budget, a Senior employee knows the possible ways to move forward and is able to select an appropriate technical approach for each client. A Senior UI Engineer is also expected to be a good communicator. They are skilled at providing actionable feedback and recommendations both internally to managers/teammates and externally to clients/vendors. Senior UIEngineers deliver successful projects by writing quality code, participating in important strategy conversations, and assisting with code reviews.
