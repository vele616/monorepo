Senior Team Leads are responsible for managing the successful delivery of client work, project-centric operations, and personnel within a single team. The primary functions include: driving superior outcomes in alignment with established scopes, timelines, and budgets for multiple, concurrent projects; expertly incorporating 10up standards and processes in the delivery of client work; managing personnel assigned to a team; expertly collaborating with discipline directors and the Accounts team to deliver on client expectations; and managing to established production metrics (billable targets, forecasting accuracy, etc.).

## Responsibilities (Project Delivery)

*   Manage execution of project and task assignments for all direct reports, leveling up individual availability to immediate manager and the Project Resourcing Manager for resolution.

*   Demonstrate senior-level client expectation management across active client work, minimizing delivery-centric escalations to the Accounts team.
*   Lead discovery engagements (onsite and remotely) that expertly define cross-discipline project requirements. Translate requirements into comprehensive project approaches / plans that align with established timelines and budgets and can be executed successfully by project teams. Collaborate with Accounts to develop scopes of work following discovery.
*   Drive client satisfaction and encourage account growth through repeated project delivery successes, strategic differentiation, and proactive partnership with Accounts to identify and confirm additional work opportunities.
*   Maintain a predetermined billable utilization, typically between 26-30 hours / week (65-75%).

## Responsibilities (Personnel Management)

*   Directly manage 7 - 9 production team members (typically engineers and designers) in the delivery of client work and in alignment with established production metrics.
*   Conduct regular one on ones (once a week) with direct reports with an emphasis on continuously improving project approaches and outcomes as well as an individual’s overall performance.
*   Mentor and advance project management talent assigned to the team.
*   Provide regular verbal and written feedback to direct reports, celebrating successes and clearly defining any misalignments with expectations. Escalate thematic or recurring performance issues to immediate manager for resolution.
*   Review / approve PTO requests for all direct reports and ensure project delivery schedules / resourcing are adjusted accordingly.
*   Contribute to the compilation and delivery of performance reviews for all direct reports.
*   Contribute to Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) for direct reports as necessary.

## Responsibilities (Operational Management)

*   Proactively maintain accurate forecasts using established resource forecasting tools for all active client work.
*   Perform weekly timesheet reviews for all direct reports, identifying and reporting on areas of concern such as billability, excessive weekly burn, and / or inaccurate / poor time entries.
*   Monitor billable performance for all production personnel and collaborate with direct manager to align individuals with established targets.
*   Collaborate with Financial Manager to prepare invoices for all assigned project work.

## Requirements
